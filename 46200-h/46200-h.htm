<p class="pn center p4 large">BOOK ONE</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I</h2>


<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Sarah Brailsford hurried through the April
downpour holding her lantern with its shining
reflector high above her and picking her way
among the puddles which gleamed in the lantern
light. Now and then she would stop to listen or
would hallo in her sweet, anxious voice, "Stanley!
Oh, Stan!"</p>

<p>The lantern cast gigantic shadows behind each
boulder, fence-post and clump of hazel bushes as
she splashed along between the rushing buggy
ruts with an unreasonable panic in her heart. The
willow branches from the trees beside the ditch
whipped wetly across her face and shoulders. She
brushed them aside without stopping and crossed
the bridge over the flooded creek.</p>

<p>She lowered her head to fight the mounting
wind, and labored up the hill through muddy torrents
until she stood at last beneath the giant
cottonwood with half the world below her. Then
as she rested, panting from her climb, the distant
lightning flared and the panic left her.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>There lay the lake she had known since she was
a child, the marshes, the great banks of peat, the
far dark mound covered with oak trees which was
Charley's Bluff, the limestone cliff at Lake House
Point rising white and majestic above the black,
rain-swept waters. The fields and woods and
rivers of Wisconsin lay all about her like the walls
of home.</p>

<p>She hurried on now, certain that she would find
him, knowing that any moment she might hear the
clop, clop of the horse's hooves and the creaking
of the light spring wagon. And she was not surprised
when at the turn of the road she heard his
deep, full voice which even now that she had
reached her forty-third year could move her. The
man was roaring a hymn above the storm.</p>

<p>But she was not prepared for the sight which
greeted her eyes when the lightning flashed again.
Stud Brailsford was between the thills where the
horse should have been, trotting through the rain,
singing and hatless. The rain was in his graying
curls and running down his face. He looked a
giant in the lantern light.</p>

<p>"Stanley! Stanley! what's happened? And
who's that in the wagon? You'll both catch your
death."</p>

<p>She rushed to meet them crying out her surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and before her husband could answer had lifted
the lantern to look into the eyes of the drenched
girl on the wagon seat, eyes very bright and expectant,
curls the color of straw bursting from
under a wide-brimmed picture hat from which
drooped two dilapidated ostrich plumes. The girl
of perhaps eighteen straightened under Sarah's
gaze.</p>

<p>"Lightning struck Old Peg," the man explained,
"so I played horse for Early Ann."</p>

<p>It's after midnight, Sarah thought. He's come
from town with a strange girl, and....</p>

<p>"You must be about tuckered out," she said.</p>

<p>"Me, tuckered?" The big man laughed. "You
should have seen me come up Gravel Store Hill."</p>

<p>"He's a good horse," the girl said. Her
laughter was deep and unexpected. Her voice
strangely rich for one so young.</p>

<p>"Get up in the wagon with the girl and put
your coat around her."</p>

<p>Worrying about the child instead of me,
thought Sarah climbing over the wheel to the
wagon seat. She shared her rain coat with the
shivering girl and warmed her with her own body,
while Stanley Brailsford, with the strength of a
stallion, pulled them both along the road, splashing
and singing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the girl ceased to shiver. She tilted her
hat and pillowed her head upon the older
woman's shoulder. And there she rested until
Brailsford cried, "Here we are!"</p>

<p>And so it was that Early Ann Sherman came to
the Brailsford farm on Crab Apple Point in the
dairy country of southern Wisconsin in April of
the year 1913.</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Stud Brailsford was a breeder famed throughout
southern Wisconsin. He had a Poland China
boar, a Jersey bull, and a Percheron stallion
which were the talk of the countryside. He had
cornfed sows which looked like minor blimps
wallowing in his pig yards and scratching their
ample backs against mail-order scratching posts
which turned like screws twisting sinuous curls
of soothing grease upward to salve the noble
porcine flanks; soft-eyed Jersey cows whose pedigrees
compared favorably with that of any reigning
monarch; Shetland ponies, Shropshire sheep,
and a small herd of goats.</p>

<p>On the little pond which lay like a blue mirror
in a hollow between the hills a quarter of a mile
north of the house he had tame geese, three varieties
of tame ducks, as well as wild mallards, pintails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
redheads, and canvasbacks brought home
wounded from the fall duck hunting, clipped and
kept to propagate more of their species. Wild
Canadian geese he also had whose honking overhead
in the short flights they essayed about the
farm had all the fierce challenge of their kind,
all the longing for distant marshes, and the fire
of spring.</p>

<p>For spring was upon the land&mdash;</p>

<p>Spring had come rushing up the Mississippi
valley out of the warm Gulf states, out of the
bayous and river bottoms bringing the fragrance
of wet earth and leaf mold, the sweet smell of
sap running in the maples, the acrid smells of
dung and marshland. At Rock Island, Illinois,
spring, and the wild fowl, had turned off the
main stream to follow the Rock River valley up
through Rockford, Beloit, Janesville, until at last
with a final onslaught they had taken Lake Koshkonong
and the farms and oak woods along its
shores.</p>

<p>Overnight wildflowers bloomed on the hills,
buttercups, anemones, dog violets, real violets,
and the gaudy dandelions which children held
beneath each other's chins to discover with great
certainty who did and who did not like butter.
Pickerel began to run up the creeks and back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the marshy bays of the lake; the little streams
were flooded, and furry buds no larger than the
ears of mice began to show on the black, gnarled
branches of the oak trees.</p>

<p>And spring to Stanley Brailsford meant plowing.</p>

<p>"Hi up there, Bess!" he shouted. "Get a
move on, Jinny."</p>

<p>He guided the plow with one hand for a
moment, using the other to slap the reins sharply
across the sweating flanks of the team of mares.
He turned them with an expert grace at the end
of the furrow, went down along the fencerow and
around the outer edge of the field.</p>

<p>A dozen white chickens, two or three bold
robins, and Shep, the mischievous young farm
dog followed the furrow in an absurd parade. The
birds were greedy for the pink angle-worms, fat,
purple night-crawlers, and succulent grubs. The
dog delighted in making the chickens leap six
feet into the air with playful passes at their proud
white tails.</p>

<p>"Get along you lazy hunks of horseflesh," Stud
told the team. "Pretty near time we had this
twenty planted. What you horses going to eat
next winter, sawdust?"</p>

<p>He stopped for a moment to wipe his forehead
with his red bandana pulled from the voluminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
depths of his overalls pocket, gazed back over
the neatly pleated acres of moist, black soil to the
meadow beyond, and to the sandy beach of the
big lake beyond that. A pickerel splashed in
the shallow water.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses, that must've weighed twenty
pounds," Stud told the dog.</p>

<p>Even the fish were frisky today. Shep was
frisky and so was Stud. Ulysses S. Grant was
acting like a wild boar, Napoleon more like a
Texas longhorn than a Jersey, while Admiral
Dewey, the Shetland pony stallion was the worst
of the lot.</p>

<p>The Admiral had a habit of biting bigger
horses' legs, then leaping about, prancing and
whinnying. Stud knew it was a bad policy to
let a stallion run loose in the pasture but he
couldn't find it in his heart to shut the little rascal
in the barn. The Admiral and Mrs. Dewey were
the happiest married couple he had ever seen.
They had been running together for five years
now. Five pony colts had made Mrs. Dewey look
a bit matronly, but the little Stallion was still a
holy terror.</p>

<p>"Sarah's a bit like Mrs. Dewey," thought the
man. "Quiet, and good and sort of sweet. But
me, I'm like the Admiral."</p>

<p>The dinner bell cut across his thoughts with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
distant hollow clangor, now full and near as the
breeze brought it directly to his ears, now remote
and thin as the wind veered. The horses pricked
up their ears and stamped impatiently, Stud,
whistling loudly and merrily, unsnapped the
tugs and clucked. Released from their dragging
burden the team trotted over the soft earth at
such a pace that Stud Brailsford had to break
into a run; and the three of them, the two beasts
and the man, came into the barnyard in a whirl
of leaping, screeching chickens, hissing ganders,
and the hearty hallo of Early Ann.</p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">On the broad kitchen stoop Brailsford scraped
the black dirt from his shoes, then, whistling,
went in to wash. Sarah hurried to prime the
cistern pump which wheezed and creaked as it
gushed forth a clear stream of clean-smelling
rain water. He scrubbed face and hands with a
coarse yellow soap, dried himself vigorously on
the crash roller-towel, ran the family comb
through his curls, and hesitated for a second to
look at himself in the uneven glass of the old
walnut-framed mirror.</p>

<p>What he saw evidently pleased him: clear blue
eyes which could laugh or be very angry, wrinkles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
at the outer corners more from smiling than from
squinting into the sun, a two-days' growth of
heavy black stubble over cheeks both ruddy and
tan, a good, straight English nose which went
oddly but well with the slightly spoiled, pouting
mouth; good teeth, a high forehead which bulged
at the temples, but was in no way out of proportion
to the leonine head with its mass of graying
curls. He pulled at his jowls tentatively. No
use shaving until Sunday morning.</p>

<p>"Thought you rang the dinner bell, Sarah,"
he said smilingly as the hot, somewhat harassed
woman shuttled back and forth from the roaring
cook stove to the kitchen table. "Guess we'll have
time for a tune."</p>

<p>He crossed the wide, low-ceilinged room to the
graphophone on the big desk under the north
window, pushed aside mail-order catalogues, the
ten-pound family Bible and back numbers of farm
magazines, gave the little crank a dozen turns,
and from a homemade box studded with big
wooden pegs drew a heavy cylinder record.</p>

<p>"Edison record," the huge tin horn painted
like a tiger lily bragged in a cracked barytone.
"For I Picked a Lemon in the Garden of Love
Where They Say Only Peaches Grow...."</p>

<p>"You play that just to tease me," the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
said. She spoke softly and indulgently as a
mother might speak to a mischievous child.</p>

<p>Early Ann came in with an armload of
smoothly split oak and hickory which she dumped
into the wood box. Her strong round arms looked
very capable for the task and there was something
delightful about the disarray of her blond curls
and the little beads of perspiration on her forehead.
Her movements were effortless and unstudied.</p>

<p>Stanley found himself perplexed. Where had
he seen the girl before, years ago? There was a
momentary flash of moonlight and willow trees,
but the vision evaded him. He gave up the
puzzling problem as Gus, the hired man, came
in from the barns.</p>

<p>"It's hawg cholera this time all right," announced
the excruciatingly ugly man. "I don't
doubt every one of them Poland Chinas'll be dead
by next Sunday."</p>

<p>"That ain't hog cholera, and you know it,"
said Stud.</p>

<p>"Well, if it ain't it ought to be," said Gus,
slouching into his chair at the table. "I'm plumb
sick of them hawgs."</p>

<p>"They're good hogs," Stud said. "What's the
matter with 'em?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Matter!" said Gus. "There's plenty the matter.
You treat 'em better than you treat your
hired help, that's what's the matter. I'll probably
be sittin' up all night with that sow holding a
hoof and takin' her temperature."</p>

<p>"It's better company than you usually keep
nights," said Stud.</p>

<p>"There you go again," Gus complained, "always
accusing me of being out nights. You know
as well as I do that I ain't courted a girl in twenty
years."</p>

<p>"And with all the girls from Brailsford Junction
to the Fort raring around like mares in heat
every time they get sight of you."</p>

<p>"Hush, Stanley," said Sarah, "don't forget
Early Ann."</p>

<p>"She'll just have to get used to us, Sarah,"
Stanley said. "She'll have to get used to the way
we talk around here."</p>

<p>"Ain't we going to eat sometime today?" Gus
asked. "I thought I heard the dinner bell."</p>

<p>"There, the duck's just done," said Sarah. She
slipped it deftly onto the willow-ware platter.</p>

<p>"Duck on a Saturday?" asked Stud with mild
surprise. He viewed the sweet potatoes, mashed
potatoes, the great bowl of gravy, baked apples,
bread-and-butter pickles, the pile of hot homemade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
bread in thick slices, the apple and gooseberry
pies and large graniteware pot of coffee
with something like lust.</p>

<p>"Duck on a week-day?"</p>

<p>"You know Peter came home today. He....
Oh, Stanley, he's quit school! He said he couldn't
stand it another day."</p>

<p>"And so we kill the fatted calf," said Stanley
quietly. "Well, why doesn't he come to dinner?
What's keeping him?"</p>

<p>"He's upstairs changing into his overalls. You
might as well begin."</p>

<p>She stopped half way between the stove and
table as Stud began the blessing. She cast her
eyes down as the words ran on.... "God is
great and God is good, and we thank Him for this
food...." She saw the wide pine boards of the
kitchen, worn white and smooth from years of
scrubbing. Then she shut her eyes and said a
little prayer of her own for Peter and for Stanley
Brailsford.</p>

<h3 class="p2">4</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Something was troubling young Peter Brailsford,
something he couldn't quite get at or understand.
He wasn't at all certain why he had run
away from school in Brailsford Junction, or why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he had come home instead of hooking a freight
for Chicago as he had originally planned.</p>

<p>He hated school, and the farm, and most of
all himself. He hated all the girls in the world.
He was shy in the presence of his father, and
sometimes felt a flare of impatience, almost dislike
for the older man. He had left the dinner
table quietly, slipped on a sweater patched at the
elbows, glad to be away from the hired man's
teasing, from his mother's over-solicitous love.</p>

<p>He strode across the lawn, leaped the fence,
and started up the lane to look for the ponies,
wondering in his mind who this new girl could
be, thinking of the hot, angry scene in the Principal's
office when he had announced that he was
quitting, remembering how he had thrown his
books into the creek, and jumped on his new red
motorcycle, wild to be feeling the wind in his
hair.</p>

<p>But even the thought of that happy, rebellious
ride on his fine fast motorcycle with its shining
nickel headlight and bright red mudguards was
not enough to keep his mind from running hot
with the vague injustices of the world. He kicked
viciously at the tall dandelions and convenient
lumps of dirt. Yet he could not have told precisely
what it was that angered him, nor why the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
great peaceful spring had not caught him up as
it had the rest of the world to warm his blood.</p>

<p>He'd show them! He'd show everybody! All
the stuck-up town kids with their smart ways, all
the girls, Stanley, his mother, Gus, everybody!</p>

<p>There was a great deal wrong with the world
young Peter thought. Much that could be better.
He had never noticed before he went away to
high school how his father and the hired man
bullied his mother with their laughing banter,
nor how cluttered the parlor was with its stuffed
birds.</p>

<p>Momentarily he hated every inch of it: the
stink of the barnyards, the cruelties of birth and
death forever taking place about the farm; Gus
the lecherous hired hand whispering to him of
secret pleasures,&mdash;Gus forever proclaiming his
hatred for women yet tearing out the underwear-clad
wenches in the mail-order catalogues to hide
in his bureau drawer.</p>

<p>Then with the inconsistency of youth in springtime
Peter forgot his troubles upon seeing Lake
Koshkonong spread out before him, flecked with
whitecaps in the sun. He forgot his hatred for
school, his contempt for farming. He cut himself
a thorn stick and swished it through the deepening
grass, whistled "Alexander's Ragtime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Band," and with an awkward attempt at the
tango whirled and bent and thumped his feet
holding his visionary partner with a grace which
he imagined would have shamed Vernon Castle.</p>

<p>He clapped for an encore, bowed deeply to the
girl, then feeling in his pockets found fish-hooks,
sinkers, and dead night crawlers. "I'll go fishing
catfish," he thought with excitement. "I'll get me
some dead minnies, some rotten liver, and some
clams."</p>

<p>Swinging along the lane, throwing stones at
sparrows and adventurous woodchucks, he came
at last to the back pasture covered with hazel
bushes, sumac and thorn-apple trees. He made
his way along the cowpaths calling the ponies,
looking behind the clumping elderberry bushes
until at last he came upon them.</p>

<p>The little Admiral ran up whinnying to nuzzle
for the sugar lumps Peter usually carried, and
there beyond stood the patient mare guarding her
new-born colt, the wickedest-looking little fellow
who ever tried to scamper on unsteady legs.</p>

<p>He had been licked as clean as down and his
small black hooves were as bright as jewels in
the wet grass. The mare regarded him with
troubled eyes and every now and again ran her
wide nostrils over his flanks tenderly. So this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was why the mare hadn't come down to the barnyard
that morning! Peter slipped his arms under
the warm pony colt to carry him home. The mare
patiently followed.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>


<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Stud Brailsford stopped his team of sorrel
mares beside the old mill and blacksmith shop,
led Jinny in through the wide doorway and tied
her to a wrought-iron ring worn with sixty-five
years of friction. He lit the charcoal in the forge,
pumped the ancient foot-bellows, and buried a
shining shoe in the bright coals.</p>

<p>"This ain't going to hurt you a bit," he told
the nervous mare. "Your ma, and your ma's ma,
and a long ways back of that got nice new shoes
in this same smithy."</p>

<p>He whistled happily as he rolled up his sleeves,
showing huge brown arms with bulging biceps,
tied on a leather apron, and lifting the heavy
hammer gave the anvil a couple of preparatory
whangs, bell-like strokes which rang out across
the valley of the stream all the way to Cottonwood
Hill and back again.</p>

<p>"Blamed if I don't like shoeing a horse," he
told the sorrel. "Nothing like it to set a fellow up
in the morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Stud had a weakness for his blacksmith shop
and the adjoining mill which had once ground all
the grist and cut all the lumber for the entire
countryside. The old stone building was in ruins
now, the mill-wheel fallen, and the dam washed
away, moss and vines covered the rotting roof;
but Stud would not tear it down.</p>

<p>He liked to come down here on a wet day and
tinker around in the pile of wheels and machine
parts which littered the floor. At a bench in one
corner he kept his paraphernalia for stuffing birds,
in another his saws and planes and chisels, his
brace and bits and other woodworking equipment.
He liked to make things, and fix things, and
whang away at his anvil.</p>

<p>"Have to fix that bellows with a new cowskin,"
he announced to no one in particular.
"Must have been made before the Civil War by
my Granddaddy&mdash;and what a great old fellow he
was!" Stud fished the glowing crescent of iron
out of the coals and set to work with his hammer.</p>

<p>"Tailor made shoes for a pretty lady," he told
the anxious mare. "Can't go barefoot like a
blamed little foal."</p>

<p>So he had heard his father talk to sleek and
shining mares in this same blacksmith shop, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
so his father's father had doubtless talked to <i>his</i>
horses on this very spot. Stud had a sneaking
fondness for horses and ancestors. Particularly
the big men who had come swinging into Wisconsin
in the eighteen-forties to open up this
country as if by miracle.</p>

<p>He had heard his father tell of the stormy
voyage from England in a sailing ship, the long
journey up the canal and through the Great
Lakes, the landing at Milwaukee where the
candle-lit taverns were over-run with settlers,
frontier merchants, gamblers, whores, and itinerant
ministers of the gospel who shared the unpartitioned
floors, and waded democratically through
the deep mud in the tavern yard where scores of
oxen were tethered beside their clumsy carts.</p>

<p>Stud himself remembered the last of these
"toad-crushers" with wheels cut from cross-sections
of huge oak trees. Loaded with lead and
pulled by as many as eight yoke of oxen, these
carts drew the metal mined in Galena and Exeter
across the wilds of intervening Wisconsin to the
lake port of Milwaukee. The drivers were a wild
and frisky crew, Stud had been told. It shocked
and titillated his righteous old Daddy (who had
watched the ox teams from this very window)
knowing how the drivers whored and played at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
cards in Milwaukee and the thriving town of
Galena.</p>

<p>Great fellows and great times, thought Stud
Brailsford, dipping the hissing shoe into the tub
of green water beside the anvil. Men who could
carry a three-hundred pound barrel of salt up a
steep loft stairs, Big Jock Macreedy who had set
the nine-hundred pound oak cornerpost on the
lower eighty. His grandfather's brother (for
whom Brailsford Junction was named) who had
single-handed lifted the millstone in this very
mill into its place.</p>

<p>"Hold up there, Jinny," he admonished, lifting
her tasseled leg and catching the hoof between
his leather knees. "This ain't going to hurt you
a bit, Jinny. Nice new shoes for a pretty lady."</p>

<p>There had been a log house on the farm where
the brick one stood now, and Stud had often
heard his father tell how the deer came to eat the
cabbages, and how one night a cougar had looked
in at the window.... Rain came in through the
cracks in the hand-split hickory shingles, it
whipped into the faces of the eight children
sleeping in the loft on the corn-husk mattresses
... rain and snow in the winter, mosquitoes in
the summer. Cracks between the logs which no
amount of mudding would completely fill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Stud could just remember the log house; it
had been torn down the year he was five. There
were wide stone fireplaces at either end of the
big downstairs room, tallow candles made in a
mold brought over from England on the sailing
ship, a flintlock rifle with which his father could
hit a squirrel at one hundred yards. There had
been sweet-smelling roots and herbs hanging from
the beams, seed corn, hams, and traps for catching
bobcats and foxes that came to steal the
chickens.</p>

<p>And kids all over the place. Three girls and
five boys.... Stud wished he could have a
family of husky youngsters like that. He didn't
blame Sarah for the fact that all of her babies
had died except Peter. But he did wish that Peter
could have been a real farmer. He wished that
he would quit mooning around and find a girl
and use his fists more often. He wondered if the
boy would actually run away to Chicago to work
in an automobile or trailer factory. It made him
bitter to think that farming wasn't good enough
for his son.</p>

<p>Stud drove home the tapered horse-shoe nails
with a viciousness which made the mare dance
like a tumble-weed.</p>

<p>"Whoa, there, you ornery piece of horseflesh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Act like a lady or I'll larrup the living daylights
out of you."</p>

<p>Times were soft, Stud argued. Kids got notions
in their heads. Like Peter wanting to build
automobiles or trailers. Everyone riding instead
of walking, talking about a device to milk cows
by electricity, wearing gloves for husking in the
fields.</p>

<p>When Stud was a boy men husked corn bare-handed.
He could remember how his fingers
cracked and bled in the cold, how one could
follow his trail across the snow by the drops of
blood. At night the men laughed about their
split fingers, rubbed in hot tallow, and next morning
went at it again.</p>

<p>Underwear was a luxury and almost unknown.
Men wore their coarse homespun against their
skin. The burrs in the virgin wool scratched like
pins and needles.</p>

<p>Stud put another horse-shoe into the charcoal
and worked the bellows. He tossed a handful of
hickory nuts through the open window into the
pig pen where the big sows cracked them between
their teeth and swallowed them with noisy gusto.
Stud noticed that the sick sow was back on her
feet again and as greedy as any of her fantastically
enormous sisters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Better hogs than we raised in the old days, he
thought. That's one place we've improved. Men
get meaner and weaker and filthier, while hogs
and cattle get to be better animals every year.
That's on account of the way we breed the beasts.
No romance. No guessing what's under a bustle.
Just hard-headed facts and scientific breeding.
Do the human race some good to have a first rate
breeder put in charge for a few generations.</p>

<p>"Whang, whang," went the hammer on the
anvil as sparks flew out like Fourth-of-July.
"Hissss" went the second shoe in the tub of
scummy water. The smithy was filled with the
delectable odor of hot metal and scorching hooves
and dung, age old dust and the first breath of
crab-apple blossoms now bursting on the scraggly
black trees beside the smithy window.</p>

<p>Man got meaner and smaller while the animals
got greater and finer, thought Stud again, and
that was why a man could give his best years to
raising Jersey bulls like Napoleon, or Percheron
stallions like Teddy Roosevelt ... could care
for his cattle almost more than his family. There
was a decency about animals not to be found in
men.</p>

<p>This he had known ever since as a young man&mdash;a
spoiled but good-looking young fellow who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
dominated his daddy and bought the big farm for
a song&mdash;he had found that one can't trust bankers,
share farmers, renters, or hired men, but one
can trust horses, cows, and pigs....</p>

<p>"Give 'em your best and they'll give you their
best," thought Stud. And no stock in the Rock
River valley had better care or better feed than
the Brailsford stock.</p>

<p>Stud thinks now, seeing Peter dash down
the road like mad on his new red motorcycle, that
a buggy was good enough for him at that age.
No, he didn't get his first buggy until he was
eighteen. It had red wheels and a fringed whip-socket,
and his father had given him a spanking
bay gelding to go with it. What a figure he cut
courting Sarah to the tune of "I'm the Man Who
Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo".... Black
curls, a little mustache turned up at the ends,
derby hat, pants tight over strong rippling thighs,
smart checked coat. A dashing young giant,
muscled like a bull.</p>

<p>And Sarah in her long flaring gown, curls down
the back of her neck, rows and rows of buttons,
puff sleeves and a waist so small he could reach
around it with his two hands.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sarah, you were beautiful then," Stud
says aloud. He slaps the mare sharply across her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
gleaming flank. "Get going, you lazy piece of
horse flesh."</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Miss Temperance Crandall bustled along the
road with the air of a woman who has a mission
in life. She noticed with shocked delight that
there were several pairs of young women's bloomers
on the Barton wash lines, no corset covers,
and scarcely any petticoats. Bloomers, of all
things! That was really too much. Temperance
Crandall still wore drawers, and she always said
the underwear her mother wore was good enough
for her.</p>

<p>The diapers hanging in snowy squares behind
the tumble-down Oleson household reminded her
that the Oleson baby was born less than seven
months after the young couple were married....
September, October, November, December, January,
February, March, she counted again. And
you couldn't tell her it was a seven-month baby.
She had traipsed all the way out from town the
second day after it was born to bring Mrs. Oleson
a baby sweater she had knitted, and she had
had a good look at the cute little brat. Perfectly
good fingernails and a huge mass of blond
hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter Brailsford and Dutchy Bloom were coming
down the road a mile a minute on their motorcycles,
and just before they reached the spot
where she was standing Dutchy stood up on
the seat, let go the handlebars, and started
yelling like a wild Indian. Why, he might have
killed her! He might have run right over
her.</p>

<p>"You better watch out, young man," she
shouted after him, shaking her parasol. "You
can't go up the narrow road to heaven on a motorcycle.
You're just tearing down the wide, primrose
path to hell."</p>

<p>The motorcycles were making so much noise
that Dutchy did not catch the full import of
her remarks, but he turned, nevertheless, and
thumbed his nose in answer.</p>

<p>She went in at the Brailsford gate, took the
letters out of the mail-box as she went by, stopped
behind the lilac bush at the turn of the flagstone
walk to peer through the envelopes, then composing
bonnet, shawl, flounced skirt, and lace parasol
climbed briskly up the wooden steps and opened
the front door.</p>

<p>"Sarah!" she called. "Oh-h, Sarah! It's just
me, Temperance Crandall. I just came to tell
you...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, do come in, Miss Crandall," said Sarah,
wiping her hands on her apron. "Won't you sit
down?"</p>

<p>"I really haven't a minute," said the determined
and bright-eyed person. "I've got to tell
everybody along the road about the church supper
next Wednesday night. I knew you'd bake the
pies, Sarah. You do bake the loveliest pies if
you would only use a little more shortening in the
crust and be careful not to put too much cinnamon
on your apples."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sarah, "I suppose I can bake the
pies."</p>

<p>"Oh, not all of them. Just ten or fifteen. I'll
have the Barton girls bake the rest. They ought
to do something for the good of their souls. Why,
when I went past there a minute ago I saw they
had bloomers on the line."</p>

<p>"I think bloomers are real sensible," said Sarah
Brailsford.</p>

<p>"Oh, you do!" said Temperance. "Well, I
don't. And what's more when I was listening in
this morning to see if old man Whalen had got
over his D.T.'s I heard Kate Barton and that
good-for-nothing Joe Whalen going on something
scandalous, throwing kisses over the wire and
whispering about Saturday night. You can't tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<i>me</i> that silk bloomers do a girl's morals any
good."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't a girl have pretty underclothes?"
asked Sarah. "They won't have many
years to dress pretty and have a good time."</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell Reverend Tooton to preach
a sermon on girls' bloomers," said Temperance.
"What those girls need is a good dressing down
and not so much dressing up. I must hurry back
to town and see him this very afternoon....
But what I came to tell you about, Sarah...."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Well, now I sorta hate to do it. But it's for
your own good."</p>

<p>"I'm sure we understand each other," said
Sarah Brailsford, coolly, sitting proudly in her
straight-backed chair.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm no one for beating about the bush,"
said Miss Crandall. "And far be it from me to stir
up any trouble in a Christian household. But if
you ask me, I'd watch that Early Ann."</p>

<p>"Would you mind if I closed the door into the
kitchen?" Sarah asked quietly.</p>

<p>"No, shut the door so the hussy can't hear us,"
said Miss Crandall, "not that you can ever keep
a secret from a hired girl so long as there are
keyholes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was it you were going to say?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, Sarah. I just want to do you a
good turn same as I would expect you to do for
me."</p>

<p>"Will you please come to the point, Miss
Crandall?"</p>

<p>"Since you insist, Sarah, and may the Lord forgive
me for telling you. But I think you ought to
know that Early Ann Sherman is Stanley Brailsford's
daughter, and the way they cut up together
makes it all the nastier."</p>

<p>Sarah Brailsford swayed faintly, caught herself,
and rose unsteadily to her feet. Her face
was white and pinched, but her voice was clear
and proud.</p>

<p>"I'll bake the pies, Miss Crandall." She
opened the door with a hauteur which quieted
even the garrulous Temperance Crandall. And it
was not until she was beyond the lilacs that
Temperance started worrying. "Now I've done it
again. But someone had to tell her."</p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">"You're a jinx," Gus told Early Ann as he
stood beside her in the lamp light helping with
the dishes. "Nothing but rain since the night you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
came. Never knew it to fail. That's what comes
of having a strange girl on the farm."</p>

<p>"I ain't a strange girl," said Early Ann. "I
certainly ain't as strange as you are. You're the
strangest guy I ever seen."</p>

<p>"All Gundersons have got faces like mine,"
said Gus sadly.</p>

<p>"You ain't homely," said Early Ann. "You're
awful handsome. Can you tango or sing,'You
Great Big Beautiful Doll'?"</p>

<p>"I can't sing nothing," Gus said. "Can't carry
a tune worth a cent. Stud says maybe I could
sing better if I had my tonsils cut."</p>

<p>Early Ann giggled. She looked up with flashing
eyes at the dour hired man and winked wickedly.
She giggled again.</p>

<p>"You ought to see the picture postcards I
got and the bon bon boxes, and the dance programs
with silk tassels." (How she wished she
<i>did</i> have these lovely, unattainable things!)
"I bet I could teach you how to do the Castle
Walk."</p>

<p>"Not me," said Gus. "No you don't." He cast
an apprehensive glance at the girl and all but let
a tureen slip out of his hands.</p>

<p>"You bust that tureen and I'll run you out of
the kitchen with a broom," said Early Ann.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"My, my!" said Gus. "You're a wild woman,
ain't you?"</p>

<p>"You bet I'm wild." She tossed her shining
curls in the lamp light and added a kettle to the
gleaming row of copper vessels hanging along
the wall. "I used to bite like everything when I
was a little girl."</p>

<p>"Let's see your teeth," said the hired man.</p>

<p>She flashed her white teeth, then opened wide
her pretty mouth.</p>

<p>"Yep, you're a biter," Gus said. "But you ain't
a day over seventeen by the looks of your molars."</p>

<p>"You don't know anything about girls," said
Early Ann. "All you know about is horses."</p>

<p>From the other room came the voice of Sarah
reading to Stanley by lamp light. Her voice was
sweet, but particularly colorless this evening.</p>

<p>"Where'd you come from anyway?" Gus
wanted to know. "And who are your folks?
There ain't no Shermans in Brailsford Junction."</p>

<p>"None of your beeswax," the girl said firmly.
"It's none of your beeswax where I came from."</p>

<p>"Not that I care," said Gus. "Not that I'm
curious. Ishkabibble! I should worry."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. You ain't curious. You just got your
tongue hanging out and your eyes popping, that's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
all. You're just running around like a couple of
strange new dogs. You ain't curious."</p>

<p>"It ain't nice for a girl to talk the way you
talk," said Gus. "It ain't proper for a girl to talk
about dogs like that."</p>

<p>"I wasn't talking about dogs, I was talking
about you," Early Ann said.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever want to be a lady, Early Ann?
Don't you ever want to ride in a hansom cab
or a limousine, with ostrich plumes in your hat,
and a parasol? Don't you ever want to learn how
to be sweet and talk nice like Sarah Brailsford?"</p>

<p>"She's lovely," said Early Ann with a sigh. "I
sure wish I could be like Mrs. Brailsford. But I
got a tongue like a little snake. I can't help what
my tongue says.... Sure I want to be a lady
and ride in a limousine. I want to be as graceful
as Irene Castle, and dance like an angel, and have
a house with swell brass beds and fumed oak
mission furniture like you see in the Hartman
catalogue, and a big cut-glass dish for the center
of my table, and real lace curtains, and a new
Ford with a Disco self-starter and...."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz, you must be figurin' on marrying
a millionaire," Gus said.</p>

<p>"I want things," the girl said. "All I've had all
my life is work, work, work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Her fervor had flushed her cheeks and brightened
her eyes until the vision of young loveliness
before him made Gus forget that he was a
woman-hater. He wished he were a good-looking
young fellow with some money. She'd get everything
she wanted soon enough.</p>

<p>"You better not let Temperance Crandall hear
you talk like that," warned Gus. "She'd tell
everybody from Stoughton to Fort Atkinson."</p>

<p>"What does she look like?" Early Ann asked
with excitement. "Has she got a long scraggly
neck and a raggedy black parasol, and a black
shawl, and does she wear glasses?"</p>

<p>"That's her," said Gus.</p>

<p>"Let me get my fingers around that hag's
neck," said Early Ann.</p>

<p>"You certainly do talk rough," said the hired
man. "I wouldn't want to meet you alone somewhere
on a dark night."</p>

<p>"She was over here today telling tales about
me," said Early Ann. "They shut the door and I
was too proud to listen. She's just a.... Oh,
Gus, she's just a nasty old busy-body. Mrs.
Brailsford came out in the kitchen as white as a
ghost after she left and asked for the camphor."</p>

<p>"There's something mysterious about you,"
said Gus. "I knew it from the night you came."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's just talk," said Early Ann. "They don't
know a thing. There's nothing in my life to be
ashamed of.... But it seems like old ladies just
can't leave a girl alone. There's nobody in my
past who...."</p>

<p>Early Ann broke off abruptly in the middle of
her sentence. Her eyes grew large and the terror
crept down her cheeks and caught at the comers
of her mouth. She started to scream, then bit her
knuckles and with great deliberation turned away
from the apparition at the window-pane. By the
time Gus had rushed out into the yard no one was
to be seen and the starlit night was silent and
empty.</p>

<p>In the parlor Sarah still read to Stanley, unaware
of anything beyond her own circle of lamp
light. But as Early Ann listened in the throbbing
stillness she heard the older woman falter and
stop. Then she heard quiet weeping.</p>

<p>"Why ... what are you crying about,
Mother?" she heard Stanley ask.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing at all," Sarah said. "I&mdash;I
guess I'm just tired, that's all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pn p1">The basement of the Methodist Episcopal
Church in Brailsford Junction rang with the
shouts of children playing tag despite the scolding
of their busy mothers. Flushed matrons
buzzed in laden down with loaves of homemade
bread, pans of biscuits ready for the oven, mason
jars full of sweet, sour, and mixed pickles, bags
of ground coffee, and huge pots of dressed and
dismembered chickens so tender and plump that
their flesh would have warranted the term "voluptuous"
if stewed by a less austere generation.</p>

<p>Joe Whalen, town drunk, general roustabout,
and janitor of the church was starting a paper
fire in the furnace.</p>

<p>"Put in more paper," shouted Old Mrs. Crandall,
mother of Temperance, who had left her
room for the first time in months for this occasion.
"Terrible weather for rheumatism, ain't
it?"</p>

<p>"Terrible," shouted Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't need to holler at me," said Old
Mrs. Crandall. "I ain't as hard of hearing as all
that."</p>

<p>She pulled her shawl a little tighter about her
rheumatic shoulders, and cocked a sly old ear for
the salty gossip Sister Atwell was passing on to
Sister Bailey.</p>

<p>Girls of high school age, whispering and giggling,
twisted long streamers of red, white, and
blue crêpe paper in dizzy crescents from pillar to
pillar of the festive room, while over each blazing
chromo the same laughing girls hung shooting
stars, bluebells, anemones, and other spring
flowers.</p>

<p>The chromos were of the unforgettable period
in religious art which offered holy scenes in
dazzling triads, stirring masterpieces which could
not help but move saints and sinners alike, pictures
which carried a message and a warning.
"Rock of Ages Cleft for Me" with a courageous
lady in a white nightgown hanging perilously to a
granite cross amid seas which would have sunk
the <i>Titanic</i>; an amazingly tinted "Last Supper";
Christ driving the money changers from the
temple with a ferocious rawhide blacksnake
which Stud Brailsford privately admitted a man
would not use on a team of balky mules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Flowers were also heaped upon the golden oak
upright piano, lacking three ivories, sadly out of
tune, and showing unmistakable battle scars from
the militant hammering it received during every
Sunday School session, no less than from the
attempts of Epworth League members to "rag"
such sacred selections as "Holy, Holy, Holy."</p>

<p>The kitchen was a mad-house. Along ten feet
of glowing griddles perspiring sisters of the
Ladies' Aid were stewing chickens, thickening
gravy, starting great pots of coffee (two hours
before suppertime with the result that church
supper coffee had a wallop like 100 proof Bourbon)
cutting slices of home-baked bread, quartering
apple, pumpkin, and gooseberry pies, whipping
half gallons of Jersey cream in wooden
bowls two feet in diameter, pouring into boat-shaped
cut-glass dishes jars of pickles, glass after
glass of jams, jellies and preserves.</p>

<p>Crocks of golden butter and creamy cottage
cheese made a formidable bulwark of richly laden
earthenware in one corner, while a phalanx of
ice cream freezers stood guard beside the kitchen
door. And never except in time of war were seen
such tubs of potatoes and kettles of peas.</p>

<p>Thirty tables for which thirty women had each
brought her largest tablecloth were being set with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
six hundred ironware plates and as many indestructible
cups and saucers, while what was smilingly
known as the church silverware was lined
up, knife, fork and spoon at the right of every
plate.</p>

<p>It was the scandal of the Ladies' Aid that some
of these pieces of husky serviceware were not
stamped as they should have been with "Property
of the Methodist Episcopal Church" but were
labeled instead "Property of the First Congregational
Church" or, breath of popery, heresy and
damnation, "Property of the St. James Catholic
Church."</p>

<p>A venturesome member of the Ladies' Aid who
had once attended a Congregational supper came
back with the juicy information that the Congregational
church had hundreds of knives, forks,
and spoons marked with the bold Methodist insignia.
This served as an excellent palliative to
Methodist consciences.</p>

<p>No one, of course, had ever worried about what
might have been stolen from the papists.</p>

<p>Into this wild and frantic scene shortly before
supper time came Sarah Brailsford, Early Ann,
and Gus. The hired man shuffled sheepishly
behind the protecting women folks loaded to the
gunwales with apple pies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Sister Brailsford, how <i>do</i> you do!" chorused
the sisterhood. "My, what lovely apple
pies!"</p>

<p>They greeted Early Ann with reserved enthusiasm,
insisting she must join the Epworth League,
and Standard Bearers.</p>

<p>"So important that a girl gets the right atmosphere
during her formative years," said Sister
Dickenson.</p>

<p>Across the kitchen, however, the comments were
less cordial: "Did you hear? And think of bringing
her to a church supper! You mustn't breathe
a word but Temperance Crandall told me in
strictest confidence...."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gus, red of face and almost tongue-tied
with embarrassment had been put to work
mashing the potatoes. Women came with milk,
butter, salt, and advice while Gus mashed on.
Gus thought that perhaps he would not have been
embittered about women so early in life had it
not been for twenty-five years of church suppers.</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Above the First National Bank of Brailsford
Junction with its wooden Doric columns and gilt-lettered
windows was the office of Timothy Halleck,
attorney at law, justice of the peace, dealer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in real estate and farm mortgages, notary, and
Protestant father-confessor for half the town.</p>

<p>To him came ranting suffragettes; militant
members of the W.C.T.U. bent on destruction of
the town's twenty-six easy-going saloon proprietors;
the saloon proprietors; fathers of wayward
girls; mothers of incorrigible boys; wives who
were beaten, and husbands who had been cuckolded.
Into Timothy's great hairy ears were
poured the despairs and heartbreaks which have
been the lot of man these many centuries.</p>

<p>His office was nothing less than amazing. Buffalo
skulls and polished buffalo horns from his
brother's ranch in Montana elbowed stuffed fish,
antlers of deer, and the head of a wild cat upon
the walls; five hundred dusty law tomes filled
the sagging shelves; in a glass case stood a shock
of prize Wisconsin wheat, seed corn, and dirty
mason jars filled with every variety of grain
known to horticulture. Enormous leaves of Wisconsin
tobacco framed and labeled, Indian quivers,
and year-old calendars vied for space on the
wainscoting.</p>

<p>Half a dozen swivel chairs and as many spittoons
gave the spot an air of luxurious informality
to visiting farmers, whose well informed
nostrils might have quivered distrustfully at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
dusty stench of rotting law books had it not been
synthesized with the comfortable aroma from the
livery stable next door.</p>

<p>Timothy Halleck himself, six feet two, large-boned,
gaunt, hawk-nosed, with great brown eyes
deep-socketed and thatched above with bristling
brows, white-haired and gruff, ruled like a kindly
tyrant in his chaotic kingdom. He was the town's
one-man organized charity, a poverty-stricken
philanthropist who denied himself so that he
might help others; a widower, lonesome and fond
of children.</p>

<p>He had a few old friends, among them Stanley
Brailsford now entering his office.</p>

<p>"Well, Timothy," said Stud, uncomfortable in
his serge suit and well-blacked bulldog shoes,
"still making a living robbing the widows and
orphans?"</p>

<p>"Sit down, you lazy, hog-breeding son-of-a-gun
and have a cigar," said the lawyer. "How
are those emaciated razor-backs doing on that
run-down farm of yours?"</p>

<p>"Getting fatter and sassier every week," said
Stud, biting off the tip of the cigar and scratching
a match on the seat of his trousers. "What you
been up to?"</p>

<p>"Just the usual day. Forging checks and foreclosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
on octogenarians. Where've you been
keeping yourself?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere the fish are biting. There ain't
much work to be done on a farm in the spring
time."</p>

<p>"Need a good hand?"</p>

<p>"Maybe you could do my whittling," Stud
said. "Anyhow it's a standing invitation."</p>

<p>"Might teach you how to raise hogs instead
of razor-backs. Might breed you some beeves you
could tell from bags of bones."</p>

<p>"Who'd you find to defraud your clients meanwhile?"
Stud asked. "Where would you find a
man to run your shell game while you was gone?"</p>

<p>The two old cronies glowered at each other
joyfully and let fly at the nearest gobboon simultaneously
and accurately, a symphony in expectoration
which had taken nearly thirty years to
perfect.</p>

<p>Their talk ran on: the spring floods in Ohio
and Indiana, the price of hogs, milk, and eggs,
the new trailer factory which was to occupy the
old wagon-works on the creek bottom, President
Wilson and his professorial theories, the German
Kaiser and his fight to remove one of his tenant
farmers, the ridiculous little Balkan squabbles.</p>

<p>And getting back to their own affairs Stud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
asked, "Are you going to the church supper this
evening?"</p>

<p>"No ..." said Halleck slowly. "Something
about church suppers makes me feel ... Martha
was always the center of everything, you
know."</p>

<p>"I know," Stud said.</p>

<p>"You don't appreciate a woman until you've
lost her," Halleck said quietly.</p>

<p>"No," said Stud, "I don't suppose you do."</p>

<p>"You're apt to take her for granted."</p>

<p>"Sarah's happy," Stanley said. "We get along
all right."</p>

<p>"It isn't just getting along all right," the lawyer
said, gazing down upon the street where small
boys jubilant with spring were fighting, roller-skating,
and playing marbles; little girls skipping
rope, and chalking squares for sky-blue. "It's
treating a woman like another human being. Like
an individual."</p>

<p>He swung his chair to face his life-long friend.</p>

<p>"You ain't thinking of taking up woman suffrage,
are you?" Stud asked with mild sarcasm.
"Not Pankhurst and Belle La Follette and that
sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"They don't need our help, Stanley. It's we
who need theirs. They'll get more than the vote.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
They'll get rid of corsets, smoke if they want to,
go into business, live alone in a room like Early
Ann Sherman wanted to...."</p>

<p>"I ... I wanted to ask you about her," Stud
said. "I wanted you to tell me more than you
could that night you put her in my spring
wagon."</p>

<p>Halleck hesitated, looked down at the glowing
tip of his cigar, then began slowly. "I don't think
I know much more about her than you do, Stanley.
She came to Brailsford Junction last winter
and got a job stemming tobacco in one of the
warehouses. She took a room across the track
with Mrs. Marsden,&mdash;that front room downstairs
with the outside door."</p>

<p>"And then ...?"</p>

<p>"Well, nothing really. She didn't tell anyone
where she came from, or who her folks were, or
why she wanted to live alone like that. She was
pretty and proud and full of spunk, so the gossips
got their tongues wagging ... Mrs. Marsden,
and old Mrs. Crandall, and that blue jay, Temperance...."</p>

<p>"But what was wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing so far as I know. The Hubbards
who live next door thought they saw a man
around her window one night, and on another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
occasion Mrs. Marsden heard her scream, but
when she reached the girl's room Early Ann was
alone...."</p>

<p>"The sluts."</p>

<p>"Temperance Crandall and a delegation came
to me&mdash;they always do&mdash;and said they wanted
to swear out a warrant. I told them they couldn't
swear out a warrant for a girl just because she
was living alone and there was gossip...."</p>

<p>"Dirty-minded old women," Stud said.</p>

<p>"But they insisted it was up to me to do something.
They said that if I didn't they would make
it so uncomfortable for the girl she would have
to leave town. I had to save the kid from that
pack of she-bloodhounds."</p>

<p>"And you knew I'd been sort of figuring on
getting a hired girl to help Sarah...."</p>

<p>"So I brought her down to your wagon that
night. I knew you folks would take care of her.
It was a chance to get her away from Temperance
Crandall."</p>

<p>"Not so sure you got her away," said Stud.
"Temperance turned in at our place the other
day. No telling what she dished out to Sarah."</p>

<p>"She went clear out there to start trouble?"</p>

<p>"I reckon she did."</p>

<p>"That bitch," said Timothy Halleck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">At the church supper that evening Peter had a
revelation. Maxine Larabee brushed against him
in the coatroom, and he knew as though he had
seen it in the paper that he was in love.</p>

<p>Not that Maxine had even noticed his presence.
Why should she with every boy in Brailsford
Junction running after her? She had simply
swept by in her smart tailored suit and velvet hat
exhaling the very faint odor of violets. It was not
quite nice to use violet perfume in Brailsford
Junction in 1913. It gave Maxine an air of sin
and secrecy. Peter felt a trifle heady watching
her disappear into the forbidden realm marked
WOMEN from whence came the concerted
giggles, shrieks, and titterings of a dozen high-school
girls.</p>

<p>Peter yanked viciously at his two-inch starched
collar, polished the bright yellow toes of his bulldog
oxfords with his handkerchief, kicked and
stamped to straighten the legs of his peg trousers
which had an embarrassing manner of working
up the calves of his legs exposing a vast expanse
of green polka-dot socks to say nothing of the
clips of his garters. He hummed through the
tenor part to "When It's Apple-Blossom Time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Normandy," corrected a few minor errors in his
harmony, then with the determination of a martyr
entering the arena left the comparative safety
of the coatroom and strode manfully into the
bedlam of the church basement where whole
flocks of chickens were being devoured by the
famished Methodists.</p>

<p>Maxine Larabee! So that was what had been
troubling him! But a fine chance he had with any
girl as swell as Maxine. Particularly now that he
had quit school. Why, even the college guys
serenaded her; so did rich Bud Spillman the football
hero and bully. She had more picture postcards
and sofa pillows and fraternity pennants
than any girl in Rock County. She had about
twelve different dresses and six or seven hats, and
a hat-pin which was supposed to have a real ruby
set in the head of it. A fine chance he had with
Maxine!</p>

<p>Peter was so absorbed in this new and disastrous
turn of events that he failed to answer the
greetings and friendly gibes with which he was
met as he elbowed his way to the ticket table,
purchased for thirty-five cents a frayed rectangle
of cardboard, and finding a vacant seat, set to like
the good young trencherman he was. He scarcely
noticed when Mrs. Fulton whisked away his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
empty plate and returned plump, red, and beaming
with a second helping, and he was half way
through his pumpkin pie loaded with whipped
cream before he noticed that something cataclysmic
and world-shaking was about to occur. Maxine
Larabee was taking the chair beside him.</p>

<p>"Gee, you're a regular swell tonight," the
blond vision of loveliness crowned with a coronet
braid murmured sotto voce to the embarrassed
boy beside her. She looked approvingly at the
green polka-dot tie which matched the socks, the
black curls slicked down on either side of the
central part. "Why don't you take me down to
the ice-cream parlor and buy me a lover's delight
sometime?"</p>

<p>"Me?" Peter asked, astonished. "Me take you
right down to the ice-cream parlor and buy you
an ice-cream sundae?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" the girl wanted to know. "There
isn't any law against it." She had a low, husky
voice and a thrilling little laugh which made the
goose-flesh stand up on Peter's arms and electric
chills run up and down his spine.</p>

<p>"Why don't you take me for a ride on the
handlebars of your new motorcycle sometime?"</p>

<p>"Aw, you'd get hurt," Peter said with a tinge
of his boyhood contempt for mere girls springing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
up from some remote corner of his still adolescent
mind. "You'd get your skirts caught in the
spokes and we'd both go in the ditch."</p>

<p>"Oh, I would!" said the girl, raising her eyebrows.
"Oh, I would, would I! Well, I didn't
the night Bud Spillman took me for a spin on his
motorcycle."</p>

<p>"I can go faster than Bud Spillman," Peter
said irrelevantly. "I ran him ragged the day we
raced home from Janesville. I can go a mile a
minute on my machine."</p>

<p>"Give me a ride sometime and let's see you do
it."</p>

<p>"But gee whiz, Maxine...."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz, nothing!" the girl said. "Either
you give me a ride on your motorcycle or I won't
let you take me down to the ice-cream parlor."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a ride," Peter promised, glowering
at the bit of pie-crust he was pushing about
with his fork, "I'll give you a ride that'll blow
all the hair pins out of your hair."</p>

<p>The girl tittered quietly. "You <i>are</i> a dear,"
she murmured. "But here comes mother. I'll see
you at eight down by the post office."</p>

<p>Peter got up hurriedly as Mrs. Larabee, a
buxom blonde of forty with exaggerated Gibson
Girl figure nosed her way like a lake freighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
through the lesser craft between her and her pampered
daughter.</p>

<p>"Won't you have my chair?" said the boy with
a mixture of guilt and gallantry. "No, Mrs. Larabee,
I'm absolutely all through with supper."</p>

<p>He disappeared like an eel into the milling
crowd.</p>

<p>Outside it had started to rain lightly. He
walked without hat or coat through the misty
spring dusk, his brain a tumult of conflicting emotions.
Oh, she was a beautiful girl. Such big,
clear blue eyes, such shining blond hair ... like,
like a regular gold crown on her head. Her skin
was as soft as ... as the petal of a flower, and
she had the littlest feet.</p>

<p>He wasn't worthy of her. He wasn't even
worthy to touch the hem of her garments. He, a
big awkward farm boy without any manners. He
wished he could give himself a good poke in the
jaw for not saying right away, "Why, of course,
Maxine. I would be delighted to give you a ride
on my motorcycle."</p>

<p>He thought he must be going crazy to have
argued with her like that when she had just decided
to notice him for the first time in their
lives.</p>

<p>"You big country boob," he said abusively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
"I'll bet a town fellow would have known what
to say."</p>

<p>His eyes and throat felt so funny that he
thought maybe he was going to cry, but he choked
back the tears angrily and hurried on through
the spring evening watching the nighthawks
skimming low over the houses, and the strange,
soft flight of the bats. The wind sighed in the
newly feathered elms and the arc-lights sputtered
menacingly.</p>

<p>He felt incredibly alone, infinitely removed
from the rest of the world. No other boy in history
had been so suddenly and deeply in love, so
troubled and filled with foreboding. He had
never known such a hurt as he now felt in his
breast, such an unbelievable longing, although
for what he could not say.</p>

<p>Long before eight he was standing at the post
office corner, and there he stood in the mist until
long after nine. Maxine did not come.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="p1">On the Brailsford farm the season rushed tumultuously
into June bringing honey-locust
bloom, wild roses, blue spiderwort and vetch,
changing black fields to the geometrical green of
growing corn, transforming Attila, the black
pony colt with his white star and fiery eyes into
a frisking, mischievous rascal who worried his
mother constantly, metamorphosing the Jersey
calves from fawn-eyed babies delicate as gazelles
into willful stubborn young ladies who butted
their pails of skim milk all over the barn lot.</p>

<p>"You little she-devils," said Gus, "you carnsarned
little hussies, keep your heads in your own
pails and try to learn some table manners."</p>

<p>But either Gus was never cut out for a barnyard
Emily Post, or the husky young heifers,
shoats, and foals didn't give a tinker's damn which
was the salad fork, for certainly to the most
casual observer it was obvious that the little pigs
thoroughly enjoyed wallowing in the delicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
swill that filled their feeding troughs, loved to
hang on squealing and complaining while their
matronly mothers wandered aimlessly about the
pig yard, and had no objection to nosing through
the fence for a sinful afternoon among the radishes,
peas, and lettuce of the garden plot. Attila,
with forefeet braced, tugged at the mare's black
udders until she sometimes turned and nipped
his downy hide, and once when the foolhardy little
colt started nuzzling around his daddy's flank,
the Admiral, insulted to the very core of his masculine
being, kicked and bit his tactless son into
temporary good behavior. Nor were the black
kittens in the barn above stealing milk from the
brimming milk pails.</p>

<p>Peter, his imagination soaring at the thought
of a trailer factory in Brailsford Junction,
dreamed through the corn on the sulky cultivator,
went through the whole eighty acres of waving
green, then started through it again in an
endless battle against the weeds. Early Ann
picked half a milk pail full of wild strawberries on
a southern slope.</p>

<p>The tobacco land was worked and reworked
until the soil was as fine as silk before the tobacco
setter with its big red barrel began its
monotonous journey back and forth across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
field leaving rows of green plants in its wake.
Gus and Peter dropped plants from the low rear
seats while Stanley drove the team, sitting high
up on the barrel.</p>

<p>Evenings the men, covered with dirt and sweat,
went down to the lake to bathe, waded out over
hard sand nearly one hundred yards until they
were in water deep enough for swimming. They
splashed and roared and spluttered, sometimes
raced half a mile out into the lake and back
again.</p>

<p>The corn grew so fast that Stud claimed you
could hear it if you listened carefully at night.
The pumpkin vines between the hills of corn
spread wide green leaves, and the spring lambs
which Stud was pasturing in peas and clover began
to look like something which would taste
good with mint sauce.</p>

<p>At last it was haying time. And so with hard
work and little time for play Stanley and Sarah
Brailsford approached their twentieth wedding
anniversary.</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">One evening Early Ann, Peter and Gus got out
the croquet set for a dashing game on the front
lawn. Stanley and Sarah brought out their rockers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to furnish a gallery. A catbird who thought he
was a bobolink was singing in the topmost
branches of the poplar tree.</p>

<p>"I get the red ball and mallet," Early Ann announced.</p>

<p>"They're mine," cried Peter. "I always use the
red ones."</p>

<p>"Try and get 'em," Early Ann taunted.
Swinging the mallet menacingly she dashed behind
the lilac bushes and out again, encircled
the mail box and the big oak tree, and, laughing
and screeching came to grips with Peter on an
open strip of lawn. He tried to wrench the mallet
from her hands and was surprised at her strength.</p>

<p>"Just try," Early Ann panted. She fought
with a desperation which amazed the boy. Her
hair came tumbling down and her eyes flashed
fire. Suddenly she let go of the mallet and tore
into Peter with small hard fists and flying feet.
Stud was laughing until his sides hurt. Gus was
rolling on the ground with mirth. While Sarah,
seeing that the struggle was getting rough, cried
out in consternation, "Children, children!"</p>

<p>"I hate you," Early Ann whispered passionately.
"I'll scratch your eyes out."</p>

<p>"Don't hurt yourself," Peter advised with a
superior, mocking note in his voice. He had her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
firmly by the arms now in a grip which he knew
was hurting, but she did not flinch.</p>

<p>In another moment she was laughing and
straightening her hair, but she recovered and kept
the red ball and mallet.</p>

<p>The game began in the fighting atmosphere of
technical pride, and deadly serious rivalry, which
had marked the pioneer stump-pullings and sod-breakings
of an earlier day, and which lived on
in mortal golfing and bridge frays of the 1920's.
Gus and Peter handled their striped wooden balls
on the smooth green lawn with an accuracy which
would have done credit to an expert of the cue
driving the ivories about a billiard table. Gus
was known for miles around as the croquet fiend
who had scored all the hoops in one turn at a
Sunday School picnic, while Peter could often
run a hoop from a most disadvantageous angle.</p>

<p>Early Ann made up in temperament what she
lacked in technical skill, and, whenever she had
a chance to roquet on Peter's ball, sent him flying
off into the deep grass.</p>

<p>"If Taft had played croquet instead of that
sissy game golf, he'd still be president," Stud
said. "If he'd pitched a good game of horseshoes
he could've been king."</p>

<p>"Think of them White House lawns," sighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Gus. "Gee whiz! If I was president I'd make me
the gol darndest croquet court you ever did see."</p>

<p>"Why don't we play like we used to, Stanley?"
Sarah asked.</p>

<p>"The kids are too good for me," Stud admitted.
"But I'll tell you what I'll do...."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"You bet! I'll challenge you to a game for
our twentieth wedding anniversary, Sarah."</p>

<p>They touched hands for a moment, shyly, hoping
the others would not see.</p>

<p>Playing grimly and consistently well, Peter
overtook Gus and sent that doleful individual
into loud and vituperative lament by driving the
farm hand's ball under the distant front porch.
He made his next hoop, roqueted on Early Ann,
and continued his run to win the game.</p>

<p>He couldn't help comparing Early Ann Sherman
to Maxine Larabee as they began their second
game in the heat of bitter competition.</p>

<p>"Early Ann's all right for croquet, or swimming,
or a tussle on the lawn. But she's not much
of a lady," he decided, "and nothing at all like
Maxine Larabee."</p>

<p>He shouldn't have let himself think of them
in the same breath. Early Ann was nothing but a
she wild-cat, and a tomboy. Once she had pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Gus over the wood box; and she said "damn"
when she got mad; and Gus had even seen her
trying to smoke a cigarette.</p>

<p>Maxine would never do anything like that.
Maxine would be ashamed to tussle or swear or
even raise her voice. Maxine was a lady in every
sense of the word. She looked just like the beautiful
women in the magazines, with her picture
hats and delicate motoring veils.</p>

<p>Peter bet if he could only have a new White
Steamer she would notice him again as she had
that night at the church supper. She might even
let him take her for a ride way down the river
road where they could have a weenie roast and
sing songs together. She might go to Janesville
with him for a movie and a midnight supper. Except
that Maxine wasn't the kind of a girl who
would eat a midnight supper with any boy. One
of the fellows had told Peter that she was that
kind of a girl and Peter had blackened both his
eyes and made him eat dirt and yell "enough."
It made him fighting mad when any other boy
even mentioned her name casually.</p>

<p>He always felt like saying, "You leave her
name out of this," the way men did in stories.
But he was afraid it might sound silly.</p>

<p>The way she walked! Just wheeling along as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
though all her joints had ball-bearings. She was
one girl who didn't need to practice with a book on
her head to get a perfect carriage. And her golden
hair, done up a new way every day. And such
lovely white hands and pretty nails. No, Early
Ann just wasn't in Maxine's class.</p>

<p>"Your turn," Gus shouted at Peter. "Better
stop dreaming about your girl and try to learn
croquet. I've got you down for the count this
time around."</p>

<p>"Listen, hayseed," Peter said, "you better
crawl into your cellar because this trip I'm going
to blow down your shanty."</p>

<p>He took careful aim allowing for a little rise
he knew in the lawn, curved gracefully and improbably
through the distant hoop, roqueted on
the astounded hired man's ball, drove him into
a tangle of raspberry bushes, and made two more
hoops before missing.</p>

<p>"Nothing but a greenhorn's luck," Gus complained.
He fished his ball out of the thorns,
brought it to within a mallet's-length of the court,
and promised himself sweet vengeance with
plays of prodigious technical brilliance when
next it came his turn.</p>

<p>The summer dusk came down about them sweet
and still. Far away over the hills they could hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the church bell calling the faithful to Thursday
night prayer meeting in Brailsford Junction. The
chimney swifts and martins filled the evening
sky with their graceful, airy geometry, and the
nighthawks swooped so low above them that one
might see the pale oval underneath each wing.
Far down the lake in some deep tangle of woods
the whip-poor-will began.</p>

<p>Sarah hurried off to the ice house to fetch the
half freezer of homemade ice cream left from
supper, and with it a bowl of sugared strawberries.
The game over, Early Ann went in for soup
bowls and table-spoons. And together on the
lawn, under stars so large, soft, and near they
seemed almost to be caught in the upper branches
of the oak tree, they ate such a dish for the gods
as one may never find in these later years in distant
cities.</p>

<p>The frogs began in the marshes along the lake.
The crickets shrilled. Silence was all about them
like a song.</p>

<p>After they had eaten, Peter and Early Ann
pulled up the hoops and pegs, gathered the balls
and mallets in their arms. They walked down
the dusty driveway to the wagon shed carrying
the set, and stopped at the milk house for a long
cold drink from the pump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>They were too quiet, too delightfully tired
and calm to wish to talk. Their struggle was forgotten,
and there was no upsetting emotion of
love or hate to keep them from kicking in comradely
fashion through the dust.</p>

<p>Then something altogether out of keeping with
their mood shattered the evening. The horses
in the barn yard whinnied in fright; there were
startled hoof-beats; a cow mooed anxiously.</p>

<p>"Don't go," Early Ann pleaded, holding to the
boy. "It might be...."</p>

<p>Gus and Stud came running.</p>

<p>"Someone after the stock, you think?" Gus
asked.</p>

<p>They hurried in a straggling group down to the
barnyard gate, saw a shadowy figure jump the far
fence and disappear into the dusky brush lot,
crashing through the branches.</p>

<p>"Tried to get in from the back road," Stud decided,
"came up the lane and found himself in the
barnyard. Just a tramp, I guess."</p>

<p>But Early Ann had her own opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">There are nights when men and women cannot
sleep but lie awake talking until almost dawn,
nights when they feel suddenly articulate after
long months or even years of silence. These nights
are better spent in talking than in sleep or even in
love.</p>

<p>Stanley and Sarah Brailsford went up to their
room with a lamp. A cool wind was blowing from
the lake rustling the old lace curtains at the window.
Stanley set the lamp with its brightly polished
chimney, neatly trimmed wick, and glass
base filled with kerosene (in which the lower end
of the wick floated like some pale, peculiar fish)
upon the jig-sawed walnut bureau with its cracked
mirror, and tatted bureau runner.</p>

<p>The lamp light emphasized his gigantic proportions,
projecting his huge shadow on the walls
and ceiling, lighting one half of his strong face
and leaving the other in darkness. He took off
his number eleven shoes, red and white cotton
socks, and coarse blue shirt stained at the arm
pits. He yawned enormously.</p>

<p>Quickly, with little movements almost shy,
Sarah Brailsford unfastened her gray-sprigged
percale waist and skirt. She took off her shoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and stockings as though she were ashamed to have
Stanley notice that the shoes were cracked, misshapen,
and run over at the heel, the black lisle
stockings one great mass of careful darns. Before
she removed her undergarments she slipped her
nightgown on over her head and worked beneath
the gown unfastening her patched unmentionables.
Sarah wished she could have pretty bloomers
like the ones on the Barton line. Stud could
afford a new thrashing machine that year but
no new clothes for the family. She hung her
garments neatly on a chair.</p>

<p>Unlike his careful wife, Stud Brailsford threw
off his clothes and strode about the room in his
long knit drawers like an early picture of John
L. Sullivan if you overlooked Stud's graying
hair. He stood at the window looking out at the
moonlit night, enjoying the tickle of the wind
in the heavy damp mat of hair on his big chest.
He scratched luxuriously with big blunt fingers,
then turned and rubbed his back against the
window frame, yawned, blew out the light, kicked
off his drawers, and threw himself naked upon the
cool sheet.</p>

<p>The slats of the bed creaked and groaned under
his weight, and Sarah, as always, held herself a
little rigid so that she would not roll down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the hollow he created. By morning she might be
snugly against him, but that would come about
slowly through the relaxation of sleep during the
long night.</p>

<p>Moonlight flooded the room glinting upon the
flaked mirror, the oval chromos in walnut frames
on either side of the dresser, the big white and
gold washbowl and pitcher on the warped wash-stand,
the tin chimney-hole cover gilded and decorated
with a romantic landscape, the enamelware
pot underneath the bed. It came sweetly
over the face of Sarah who in this light was
beautiful even at the age of forty-three.</p>

<p>Outside there were night sounds: a hoot owl
whooing from Cottonwood Hill, a farm dog
howling at the moon, and far away across the lake
an answering howl from some equally miserable
brother in sorrow. The curtains billowed, moths
brushed against the screen, a bittern croaked in
desolate flight over the marshes.</p>

<p>For some reason they did not fall asleep. Perhaps
it was the excitement of the man in the barn
lot, perhaps thoughts of the morrow when they
would have been wed for twenty long years.</p>

<p>"I've been wanting to ask you for weeks
now...."</p>

<p>"What, Sarah?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"About Early Ann, could she possibly be ...?"</p>

<p>"Be what?"</p>

<p>"I hate to say it, Stanley. You've always been
so good to me."</p>

<p>"Aw, Sarah, why don't you tell me what's
eating you? You ain't afraid of me, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, not afraid, I guess. But maybe you won't
like it. Maybe it will hurt you somehow....
But I must tell you, I can't go on without. Is
Early Ann your daughter?"</p>

<p>"My daughter!" He sat up straight in bed and
turned toward her. "Well, now. It ain't altogether
impossible."</p>

<p>"Oh, Stanley! I knew it, but I wouldn't let
myself think it. Only, why did you tell me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what's eating you, Sarah. I
didn't say for sure she was my daughter. I only
said...."</p>

<p>"You said it was possible...." She was crying
quietly now.</p>

<p>"Well, a young man sometimes...."</p>

<p>"I know. I couldn't be so stupid or so blind as
not to see young men all around the country....
But who was she, Stanley? No, don't tell me."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't remember her name," Stud faltered.
"But I did notice that Early Ann's face
was like...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll treat her real nice," Sarah said, addressing
the cracked ceiling above her. "I'll treat her just
like a daughter. We always did want a daughter,
Stanley."</p>

<p>"Aw, Sarah," he said. "Aw, Sarah, I'm sorry."
It was almost the first time in twenty years that
he had told her he was sorry for anything. It
was the first time in ten that he had tried to soothe
her with his big, rough hands. She could tell
that he was trying not to sob, and a sudden flow
of pity came out of her heart for the great, clumsy
fellow beside her whom she loved.</p>

<p>"I can forgive you," she said. "I can forgive
you real easy."</p>

<p>"It ain't an easy thing to forgive."</p>

<p>"I do forgive you now for being unfaithful,
Stanley."</p>

<p>"Unfaithful," he said, astonished. "I don't
know what you mean."</p>

<p>"But you just said...."</p>

<p>"How old is the girl?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen, she claims."</p>

<p>"But, don't you see, Sarah. Then she can't be
my daughter. That would be <i>after</i> we were married."</p>

<p>"You mean that never after we were married,
not once, not even one time...." There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
such a note of joy and relief in her voice that the
big man beside her was moved to find her mouth
and kiss it.</p>

<p>"What a silly woman!" he said. "What a silly
girl!" He laughed deeply, and suddenly hugged
her until it hurt. She was laughing and crying by
turns and kissing him as she had not since their
honeymoon. She rubbed his beard the wrong way,
thus giving him one of the most delectable sensations
he could experience. And he kissed the
nape of her neck as he used to years ago. A cock
crowed in the moonlight and Stanley struck a
match to read the time.</p>

<p>"Why, it's after midnight, Mother. It's the
nineteenth of June, and we've been married
twenty years."</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pbq p1 b1"><i>On July 1, 1913, Greece delivered an ultimatum
to Bulgaria. The G.A.R. turned out en masse
for the bicentennial of the Battle of Gettysburg.
The enfranchised women of Illinois promised a
new era in politics, while deans of co-educational
schools raved against the immorality of the Tango.
Big panama hats were all the rage, with ankle
length wrap-around skirts and frilly summer
blouses. Girls ratted their hair and read Ford
joke books to boys who sat beside them in the
hammock holding a box of chocolate creams.
Pitcher Brennan of the Phillies socked Manager
McGraw of the New York Giants. The berry
market was firm with a strong tone in swine. In
Chicago the coroner promised he would do something
about the crazy joy riders who had killed
twenty people in Cook County during June.</i></p>

<p class="pn">But in the home of Temperance Crandall and
her mother nothing else really mattered because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
now Temperance had a huge, careless, messy man
to run after and do for.</p>

<p>If you had told her six months before that she
would stand for a man and a cat in her best bedroom
Temperance would probably have tongue-lashed
you out of her front door and down the
street. But there they were, sleeping all day and
out all night. A scandal and a caution if you
asked Temperance. She wanted to blurt it out
to the whole town but for once she held her
tongue.</p>

<p>It was a trial and a tribulation, a plague of
boils which would have tried the patience of Job.
The Lord could testify that Temperance Crandall
had the disposition of an angel and the patience
of a saint, but even she could be driven only so
far and not one inch farther.</p>

<p>"He throws his dirty socks and underwear all
over the room," she told her image in the mirror.
"He misses the porcelain spittoon a foot."</p>

<p>She yanked the kid curlers out of her hair with
a viciousness which added a tenth of an inch to
the diameter of the bald spot which was starting
on her crown, twisted her hair into a hard knot at
the nape of her neck and punched in hairpins with
fury.</p>

<p>The filthy man and his dirty cat in her very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
best brass bed, sleeping under her nicest patchwork
quilts, dirtying her monogrammed pillow
cases drawn taut and smooth over her finest goose-down
pillows.</p>

<p>"My land-a-living, why do you tolerate the
brute?" she asked her scowling image. "He's the
seven plagues of Egypt, and that's a fact."</p>

<p>Biting her upper lip touched with the lightest
possible suggestion of a black mustache, she
pulled upon the pink strings of her corset until
the black enamel eyelets threatened to rip completely
out of the fabric, hastily donned a corset-cover,
thrust her legs into a luxurious pair of lisle
hose, snapped on garters hanging from the corset
before and aft, pulled them a bit too tight, added
a pair of stiff white petticoats to her ensemble,
then plunged like a swimmer into the mass of
calico, which, when jerked into position over her
gaunt posterior, assumed the general outlines of
a dress.</p>

<p>For a moment a buttonhook clicked on the
beady jet buttons of her high shoes; there was a
snap as she pinned the chain of her pince nez to
her under-developed bosom. A touch of rose water
now and the effect was complete.</p>

<p>Down the stairs she pattered while the grandfather
clock in the hall boomed five of a bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
July morning. Beyond the hall window the
bachelor buttons wore their brightest blue; the
four o'clocks were just closing for the day, but
the pastel trumpets of the morning glories, the
sun-loving zinnias and climbing roses were at
their best in a garden which had not changed its
general appearance in forty years.</p>

<p>She banged the hall door at the foot of the
stairs with a violence which shook the light-timbered
house and sent down an avalanche of soot
around the parlor stove-pipe, marched out the
kitchen door and down the garden path to the not
unromantic privy covered with grape vines and
ivy.</p>

<p>Later as she washed in a graniteware washbowl
in the kitchen sink she ruminated upon the disastrous
day she had taken a man into her house.
He had come up the long board walk which led
back through nearly one hundred yards of trees
and shrubbery to the hidden clapboard residence
of the Crandall women.</p>

<p>"Heard you had a room to rent," he said,
vaguely. "Nice and quiet back here." He looked
about him with a dull but satisfied air and stroked
the big black tom cat in his arms.</p>

<p>"It's three dollars a week, mister," Temperance
had said severely. "That's just for bed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
breakfast. I don't do no laundry, and I don't like
cats. Besides there hasn't ever been a man in my
house, and I don't think there ever will be." She
banged her feather duster against the peeling
porch rail.</p>

<p>"That's all right," the man said, "Tommy and
I ain't particular."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you ain't particular," she mocked.
"Well listen here my good man. You'd better
be particular when you crawl into my best bed."</p>

<p>"I don't want to sleep in your bed. I want to
sleep by myself."</p>

<p>"Don't get sassy or I'll bat you over the head
with this feather duster," Temperance warned.</p>

<p>"All right, Sister," the man said. "All right.
Are you going to rent me the room or ain't you?"</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," Temperance said. "Come
in and have a chair but leave that filthy cat out
of doors."</p>

<p>"It ain't a filthy cat," the man said. "Maybe
in another life this cat was your grandmother."
Temperance shuddered. The man stooped to come
in through the door&mdash;his cat still safely in his
arms. He slouched comfortably into a red plush
easy chair and put his head back against the lace
doily.</p>

<p>"Three dollars a week in advance," Temperance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
said. "And mind you I have a sick mother who
mustn't be disturbed. She's bedfast and hard of
hearing, and she'd probably have a relapse if she
knew you was in the downstairs bedroom."</p>

<p>"I get you, Sister."</p>

<p>Why, Temperance Crandall! Whatever are
you thinking of? the good woman asked herself
while showing the man to his room. Why not
tell Mother? Evil woman! Nasty woman! She
bustled about the parlor flicking the dust from
the gilded cat-tails, ferocious crayon portraits of
her ancestors, and the model of the Washington
Monument made of ground-up paper money.</p>

<p>But if Temperance had any idea she could deceive
her mother she was rudely disillusioned the
next morning when she took toast and poor-man's
tea to the invalid.</p>

<p>"Temperance," shouted the old lady. "You've
got a man in the house."</p>

<p>"But, Mother. How did you know?"</p>

<p>"Smelled him," said the old lady.</p>

<p>"Smelled him?"</p>

<p>"Tobacco and shaving soap. I'm no ninny."</p>

<p>Luckily her mother wasn't shocked, said that
what they needed around the house was a man.
But Temperance on due consideration decided
not to tell the neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>She remembered that Brailsford Junction was
one bee-hive of gossips. They would be sure to
suspect the worst and add a few details of their
own. How Temperance hated gossips!</p>

<p>Not that everything wasn't Christian and
proper with her mother there every moment for
a chaperon. And not that Temperance would
carry on with her roomer the way Mabel Bentley
had done with that railroad man. Nevertheless
some women she knew had evil minds. She didn't
trust them.</p>

<p>She patted the sofa pillows embroidered with
"God Bless Our Happy Home" into an engaging
fullness of ripe curves, straightened the doily on
the easy chair, and singing in a lusty off-keyed
falsetto the touching strains of "Blest Be the Tie
That Binds," rustled off to the kitchen to fix her
boarder a tray.</p>

<p>My how the morning had flown. Eleven o'clock
already. High time he was up and eating breakfast,
the lazy, filthy brute and his dirty tom cat.</p>

<p>Such a big strange man. Huge, simply huge.
And with a ferocious appetite. She thought he
would eat her out of house and home. It cost
more than three dollars a week to feed the big
lummox.</p>

<p>"Our hearts in Christian love," warbled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
busy woman as she hastened about the old
wainscoted kitchen, banging the spiders and pots
loudly enough to wake the dead. He certainly
should be up by this time. Almost noon, imagine!
And Temperance up and busy since five o'clock.</p>

<p>Three boiled eggs, five slices of toast, a whole
pot of coffee that held at least five cups, oatmeal
in a bowl, cream and sugar, and, well, she might
condescend to put one of those rambler roses from
over the back stoop upon his tray. Not that he
would appreciate it, the filthy, lazy thing. He'd
better pay his board bill today or she'd throw
him out like dishwater.</p>

<p>There, that tray looked nice. Altogether too
nice if you asked Temperance Crandall. She
whisked off her apron, looked into the kitchen
mirror for a second, pushed her hair this way and
that, sneaked a pinch of flour out of the flour bin
and dusted it on her nose with the corner of a
dish towel, then assuming the air of Fox's entire
conference of martyrs picked up the tray for
prompt delivery.</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Joe Valentine was dreaming about a cat he had
for a mascot in the Spanish American War, about
the time the little tabby scratched hell out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
colonel, when the sharp rat-a-tat-tat at his bedroom
door awoke him from his slumber. He
pulled the covers up around his chest for the sake
of modesty, thus exposing his large left foot. He
buttoned the two top buttons of his summer underwear.</p>

<p>"Come...."</p>

<p>"It's just me," said Temperance Crandall. "I
hope I ain't intruding upon your privacy." She
hesitated a moment on the sill, then boldly entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Just a bite and a sup," said Temperance. She
crossed to the bed to set the tray upon her roomer's
unaccustomed lap, then screamed in terror as the
black cat rose out of the covers like a bad dream,
spitting and scratching.</p>

<p>"Horrid thing," she cried. "Evil, nasty thing.
You'll be the death of me yet, you two."</p>

<p>She took in the room with one scornful glance:
the bedspread thrown in one corner, the big shoes
on her cedar chest, his clothes in a heap on the
floor, a cigar-stub in her hand-painted porcelain
pin tray.</p>

<p>"Ain't you ashamed to be so messy?" she cried,
picking up his trousers gingerly and hanging them
on the closet door-knob, putting his muddy shoes
on the floor and rapidly folding the bedspread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
catching the fold in her teeth but never ceasing
to talk.</p>

<p>"All right," said Joe, his mouth full of toast.
He pulled a buttery and delicious central tidbit
from the slice of toast and fed it to the cat.</p>

<p>"Cigar ashes everywhere," Temperance said.
"You're just driving nails in your own coffin with
that filthy weed ... nicotine ... plain poison
... look at the yellow on your fingers."</p>

<p>"All right," said Joe.</p>

<p>"Why don't you be a man?" said Temperance.
"You're big enough, the Lord knows. Why don't
you get a job? Gadding about all night."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go do your knitting?" Joe
asked, wrapping his large mouth around an entire
boiled egg.</p>

<p>"Well, I like that," said Temperance Crandall,
placing her hands on her hips and glaring at the
man in her best bed.</p>

<p>A pretty figure he cut: hair down in his eyes,
a two-days' growth of beard on his face, a nose
that went straight for an inch or two then
detoured to the right, large loose lips, big even
teeth stained with tobacco, heavy biceps that were
somehow flabby, shoulders of a tired coal-heaver.
The great toe of his large left foot which was protruding
from beneath one of her best quilts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
twitched excruciatingly against the second toe of
the same foot. The bottom of the foot was covered
with yellow calluses.</p>

<p>"You make me nervous," Joe said. He took
another cup of coffee for a bracer.</p>

<p>"After the way I've slaved for you," said Temperance;
"Done all your washing free, fixed your
meals at any hour of the day or night when all
you should get is breakfast. You're just a filthy
brute."</p>

<p>"All right," Joe said.</p>

<p>"No appreciation. Never a thank you."</p>

<p>"I didn't ask you," Joe said. He ripped the
center out of another slice of toast and offered
it to the cat, then slowly sucked the butter from
each of his fingers.</p>

<p>"Either you pay your board and room today
or else ..." she threatened as she flaunted out of
the room, slamming the door behind her. She
found that for the first time in months she was
dangerously near to tears, and she brushed these
obvious symbols of weak, womanly emotion out
of her tired eyes with angry knuckles. She just
wasn't herself lately, she observed.</p>

<p>"I ... I'm going through the change of life,"
she thought, "and Lydia Pinkham ain't doing
me a bit of good."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The thought suddenly came to her, as she
slumped down beside the window unnoticing of
the lush summer just beyond the screen, that there
would never be any children for her. And for
just a moment she let herself be sentimental and
think of Timothy Halleck, of sleigh-rides through
the frosty starlit nights, of Virginia reels, and
box sociables, of poetry she had written as a girl,
and again of Timothy Halleck, who never knew,
and would never know to his dying day that Temperance
Crandall sat by her front window morning
and night to see him pass.</p>

<p>From upstairs she heard the demanding voice
of her mother whom she had taken care of uncomplainingly
since her twenty-second birthday.</p>

<p>"Coming," she called.</p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">What did you want, Joe Valentine? Where
were you going? Wandering through countless
nights, your cat on your shoulder!</p>

<p>The big man slouched through the alley behind
Brailsford Junction's Main Street. He passed the
litter of broken boxes, barrels and piles of rotting
fruit in tangled shadows behind the Dingle
Brothers' general store where bats swept low between
the wooden buildings. His feet knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
cinders, and his eyes, like the cat's, could see in the
dark.</p>

<p>He skirted the cubistic mountains of empty
beer cases behind the Golden Glow Saloon, the
heap of manure behind the livery stable, the
jumble of wrecked parts and rusting bodies piled
at the back door of the Ford Garage.</p>

<p>A dirty stream bubbled in the ditch that
paralleled the alley, and a huge black rat
bloated with young leapt up the ash pile almost
level with his face. The cat stiffened like some
electric thing, lashed his tail and sprang. The
rat went back on her hind legs waving ineffectual
little feet exposing her vast soft belly. A shadowy
struggle, a high-pitched squeal of terror. The
man laughed shortly; slouched on.</p>

<p>He passed the Ritz Royal Hotel smelling of
hash and strong disinfectant; the barred back
windows of the First National Bank; the empty
ice-cream freezers and cartons behind the Tobacco
City Ice Cream Parlor.</p>

<p>All closed, dark and deserted, no laughter or
singing, the player piano still. From the high
clock tower of the old town hall the chimes spilled
the half hour. Far away across the river a train
whistled, rumbled over the railroad bridge, was
muffled by the intervening hills, rushed dangerously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
upon the town screaming and clanging,
swept westward, died away in a distant whisper
of steam and clicking of wheels which lasted in
the imagination long after the night was once
more silent and deserted.</p>

<p>The air was cool now after the long hot day.
A breeze from the river valley to the east of the
town swept through the alley stirring little whirlpools
of dust. The air was suddenly filled with
the cool breath of rotting oak leaves, dank river
odors, algæ, fish and flowing water.</p>

<p>He thought of a shack among the willows, a
box-car home on the river bottom; his mother
coming home early in the morning, lighting the
fire as though she had not been gone for nearly
a month. Her dancing slippers were covered with
mud, her party dress torn. The big man who
was his father turned in his bunk, swore at the
woman, went out banging the sagging screen
door.</p>

<p>"Look Mother," Joe whispered, "we got a
new kitten while you was gone."</p>

<p>River smells, fishing catfish down at the
narrows, sitting all night on the sandbar listening
to the "tick, tick," far down underneath the
water, the splash of muskrats, the little crying
noises made by raccoons in the cornfield on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
hill, the whip-poor-wills, and the hoarse cry of
night birds following the river.</p>

<p>Oars dipping into the water, boats being pulled
up on distant sandbars, the mosquitoes and the
damp chill, the lordly battle with a sixteen pound
catfish in the dark. Bad whiskey, later on a
woman.</p>

<p>He breathed the night air wistfully. Never
again a woman's arms about him. Lost, deprived,
utterly alone. He was not aware of these thoughts
as words. He did not think in words but in odors,
colors, sounds, and a blind hatred which he could
not understand. Cheated, haunted by some unknown
thing, filled with sudden fear at a footfall,
foolhardy in the face of actual danger. A
man who could no longer call himself a man since
that knife fight with a nigger in Rockford, Illinois.</p>

<p>He came at last to the one light burning in the
alley, a dim green globe above a door (three steps
down) between two walls of sweating brick.</p>

<p>The twenty-six legitimate saloons serving the
eighteen hundred inhabitants of Brailsford Junction
were closed at this hour. Only the blind pig
offered solace to the Dago section men, the farm
hands making a night of it in town, and Hannah
Leary who had spent half her life looking up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ceilings of empty box-cars on the siding and at
stars above the Brailsford Junction Cemetery.</p>

<p>Joe hesitated at the top of the stairs, drinking
in the aroma of the place: sweat, rot-gut
whiskey, women. He ran the tip of his tongue
over his full, loose lips; felt in his pocket for
change.</p>

<p>A big man stumbled out of the door at the foot
of the stairs, started forward, saw Joe blocking
the way, and roared in a drunken voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Getahelloutamawayou."</p>

<p>Joe did not move.</p>

<p>The man lunged forward, fell, leapt to his feet
and charged up the stairs&mdash;</p>

<p>"Outamawaygodamnya."</p>

<p>Joe tipped him over with a right to the chin.
At the bottom of the stairs once more the man
drew a knife and waited his chance. Joe took a
pair of brass knuckles out of his pocket, slipped
them onto his hands, pressed the buttons with his
thumbs and little knives appeared on each
knuckle. He slashed at the air breathing deeply
and feeling fine. He pranced on his toes.</p>

<p>"Come on up," he offered.</p>

<p>The other was more careful now, almost sober.
He advanced a step at a time watching his footing,
his knife drawn down and back for the uprip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the belly slash. He stank of whiskey and bad
teeth.</p>

<p>Joe let him reach the top of the stairs before he
aimed a kick at the knife arm. The man dropped
the knife, howling with pain, his arm half paralyzed.
He threw caution to the winds, swung with
his left, and tried to close. Joyfully, methodically,
Joe slashed him to ribbons with the brass
knuckles.</p>

<p>The man went down screaming and writhing
while Joe ran lightly up the alley. He met the
cat who sprang up and settled himself in the
crook of Joe's arm. The cat was heavier now and
licking his jowls with contentment. Together
they dodged through the dark streets and alleys,
between houses, and through the Crandall garden
to the back door.</p>

<p>"Time we were leaving this dump," Joe told
the cat.</p>

<p>A moment now for throwing his clothes and
other few belongings into a knapsack, another
moment for mussing up his bed as though he had
been sleeping there all night, back to the kitchen
door again where Temperance Crandall stood in
her long white nightgown, a lamp in her hands.</p>

<p>He reached in his pocket for three dollars and
put it on the kitchen table beside the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keep it," she said.</p>

<p>"Ain't that what you wanted?"</p>

<p>"I don't want your money."</p>

<p>He left her standing there looking at the three
dollars on the table. He swung off down the
dark street with his cat and knapsack, struck
out into the country along the back roads which
ran among the poor hill farms to the northeast.
The farmhouses were dark. The cattle
slept in the pastures. Hay was cocked in the
fields and the mingled smells of drying alfalfa,
timothy, red clover, and sweet clover came to
his nostrils.</p>

<p>Like that early morning he had come along
the country road and stopped to pump himself a
drink at the farmhouse, and the woman had come
out. That was before the fight in Rockford.</p>

<p>He swung along the dark roads talking to his
cat, watching the sky with its sprinkling of large
stars. He did not feel so lost since his fight. He
almost remembered what it was he was searching
for.</p>

<p>And so he came at last to the deserted hunting
lodge on Lake House Point early in the morning
with the sun on the whitecaps of Lake Koshkonong
and the gulls screaming greedily about the
cliff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked across the bay to where Stud Brailsford's
barns and growing fields lay sunning under
the shoulder of Cottonwood Hill.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pn p1">For days now the main topic of conversation
on the Brailsford farm had been the merits of the
various makes of cars (a much more intriguing
subject than the tramp who had been discovered
half dead near Bad Pete's blind pig in Brailsford
Junction). They talked Imperials, Elcars, Cuttings,
Speedwells, Marions, and the swank new
Garfords with the single headlight. They discussed
pro and con the new-fangled gas and
electric self-crankers. Some members of the family
wanted Prest-O-Lites while others were eloquent
for electric. Each had his own ideas
concerning which of the marvelous creations had
the most stylish lines.</p>

<p>Stud himself liked the notion of a big powerful
White Steamer. He said with the price of gasoline
going up every month a White would soon
be a real economy. Besides you could go sixty
miles an hour in a steamer.</p>

<p>"Sixty miles an hour!" cried Sarah, throwing
up her hands in dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shucks, that's nothing, Ma," Peter said. "I
can go sixty on my motorcycle."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you'll break your fool neck some
day," said Early Ann. "He pretty near went off
the Busseyville bridge with me on behind last
night."</p>

<p>"Peter, you must be careful," his mother said.</p>

<p>"Tattle-tale," said Peter. He kicked Early
Ann's shins under the table, and she kicked back.</p>

<p>"Me for an Imperial," said Gus. "They're
twenty years ahead of their time and the classiest
looking buggies you ever hope to see."</p>

<p>But in the end, of course, they bought a Ford,
and a second hand one at that, with brass braces
in front and a figure that only an owner could
love. It stood up in the air like a lumber wagon,
and you could hear it coming for a mile. It boiled
over at eighteen miles an hour, but that was all
right because the worse they boiled the better
they went. Stud shined the brass radiator until it
glittered like the gilded roof of Solomon's
Temple. Sunday was spent in tinkering with the
magneto, the lighting system, and the carburettor&mdash;that
was what finally wrecked the Sabbath
day. You had to hold your thumb just right in
cranking the thing to avoid a broken arm, and
when the engine finally decided to perambulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the whole body shook like a dish of crab-apple
jelly.</p>

<p>Stud had the appearance of a circus giant
cramped over the steering wheel. He had difficulty
in manipulating the trio of pedals with his
large feet, and the idiosyncrasies of the spark and
gas kept him guessing, but he whooped it up and
down the road like a youngster with his first
bicycle, and Sarah held on beside him, game as a
Red Cross nurse in the face of inevitable death.
Sarah purchased a linen duster and motoring veil.
Stud bought himself a pair of motor-goggles and
a linen cap which he wore like Barney Oldfield
with the visor in back. The entire family grew
suddenly sensitive to Ford jokes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, farming, even in those halcyon
days, was not all driving the Ford; and so despite
races between Peter and Stud,&mdash;the motorcycle
versus the tin lizzy,&mdash;platonic midnight excursions
by Gus in the borrowed motorcar, and
thrilling family forays about the countryside,
work went on as usual about the farm.</p>

<p>Crops were better than could have been expected.
Some parts of the great Middle West
suffered floods in the spring of that year and
drought in the late summer, but on the Brailsford
farm rains and sunny weather were neatly interspersed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
The pumpkin vines opened their yellow
flowers in corn which was waist-high by the
fourth of July. The moisture kept the tobacco
from spindling up too soon; it spread wide leaves
of velvet green in rows which went as straight as
arrows across the fertile north twenty.</p>

<p>Stud's Jersey heifers, sleek Poland China
shoats, and Shropshire lambs looked like blue
ribbon material down to the last little orphan.
A lively pair of twin kids had the family captivated
with their antics. At the age of six weeks
this pair of baby billy goats were leaping about
the shed roofs like veritable young chamois.
Sarah discovered four beautiful new hybrids
among her gladioli; and her chickens&mdash;Plymouth
Rocks and Leghorns&mdash;might have stepped right
out of the pages of the "Country Gentleman."</p>

<p>It was true that Sarah felt tired these days,
and that Ulysses S. Grant, the great Poland
China boar, was acting particularly vicious, but
on the whole the farm was running like clock
work.</p>

<p>Almost before the Brailsfords realized it the
grain had all been cut, and the thrashing crew
had descended in a hungry horde upon the farm.
Some of the oats went sixty bushels to the acre,
the wheat nearly forty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>What a time they had with the thrashers! The
womenfolks from all over the country came to
help with the baking and cooking. Country kids
for miles around rode Admiral Dewey and his
patient wife, took turns in carrying water to
the men, slid down the hay rope, begged for cookies,
played pomp-pomp-pullaway and run-sheep-run.</p>

<p>The teen-aged boys, after work in the fields,
wrestled and boxed, not always in fun. The teen-aged
girls, who helped their mothers as little as
possible, watched the boys and giggled.</p>

<p>Out in the fields and at the thrashing machine
the men labored in the hot, sticky atmosphere with
barley beards in their shirts and sweat in their
burning eyes. They pitched bundles of grain
onto the wagons, pitched them off into the thrashing
machine; they drew water for the steam
engine and shoveled coal in under the boiler; they
carried the great sacks of grain&mdash;which poured
from the shoot, winnowed, clean, and plump,&mdash;and
dumped them into the big bins in the granary.</p>

<p>They marveled at Stud's fine new red and
silver thrashing machine with its blower which
could send the golden straw into a pile at any
point he wished. They looked forward to following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
this beautiful machine up and down the valley.</p>

<p>In Sarah's kitchen the hot and perspiring
women fairly tumbled over one another in their
efforts to prepare for the hungry men. They
stewed chickens by the dozen, fried thick slices
of ham, made brown ham gravy, boiled pecks of
new potatoes, baked pies and cakes and opened
cans of pickles. There was nothing fancy about
the fare they served, but it was ample.</p>

<p>They were jovial, catty, good-natured, cross,
polite, or rude as the spirit moved them. They
dropped the "sistering" and "Missusing" of the
church suppers and called each other plain Mary,
Meg, Bert, and Cissy. They had a perfectly
grand time for all their complaining.</p>

<p>And when the dirty men burst into the kitchen,
joshing and pushing one another over chairs, pouring
well water down one another's neck, splashing
and crowding at the sink, and asking the women
why they couldn't rustle together a little food
for the real workers, the women thought of nothing
but feeding and humoring the pack. If a man
proved too obstreperous, however, these Amazons
were thoroughly capable of forcing him to eat
the extra food for which he was shouting, until
at last he had to cry "enough," grinning sheepishly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
at his defeat, while his fellows jeered and
taunted.</p>

<p>Against their better judgment, and in thorough
contradiction to their pre-conceived distrust of
Early Ann, these women were forced to admit
some merit in the Sherman girl. They noticed
how hard she worked in Sarah Brailsford's
kitchen, how, although she kidded with their men-folks,
she showed practically no inclination to
lure them into the haymow, and how, above all,
she was a friendly girl and not at all stuck up
about her good looks.</p>

<p>Good looks she undoubtedly had, the men admitted
as they lay about the lawn during the
hour of rest after their big dinner. They complimented
Stud upon his taste in hired girls, and
suggested that it was no wonder Peter took her
for rides on his motorcycle.</p>

<p>"She'll be riding a motorcycle herself one of
these days," Peter said. "She's tomboy enough.
I'll bet she could lick most of you guys in a
wrastle."</p>

<p>"Been wrastling her much, kid?" the men
wanted to know. "She looks like good wrastling."</p>

<p>Peter flushed. He had never thought of Early
Ann as a sweetheart. He had been thinking all
morning about Maxine Larabee, and how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
hoped she would drive in at one of the farms
where he was in charge of the big thrashing outfit.
Stud had told Peter <i>he</i> could be thrashing boss
that year and take the fine new machine all over
the countryside. It would be wonderful to have
Maxine hear him giving orders and directing all
the men.</p>

<p>Maybe Bud Spillman would come up with a
sneer on his face right while Maxine was there,
and Peter would knock his block off. Nothing
could be sweeter.</p>

<p>"I'd like to wrastle that girl," one of the men
was saying. "I'll bet she'd make good wrastling."</p>

<p>During the past few weeks Sarah had tried to
be particularly kind to Early Ann. She had noticed
how the girl had listened to her manner of
speech and tried to imitate it, how she had
dropped many of her "ain'ts" and "them theres,"
and was taking pains to set the table nicely. One
day Sarah had shown her some of her battered
text books left over from distant academy days.
Early Ann had taken them to her room and had
painfully waded through several of them during
the long summer evenings. She had even asked
Sarah to show her the notes on the organ and
had practiced faithfully at her scales.</p>

<p>In matters of personal appearance, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Early Ann had a flair which the older woman
lacked. She had a way of doing her hair, of
wearing a flower or a ribbon which made her
beautiful even in an apron. But in matters of
tidiness and cleanliness she learned much from
Sarah. She brushed her teeth more often now,
and every evening, to the tantalization of the
hired man, bathed in the back pantry before she
went to bed.</p>

<p>She actually worshiped Mrs. Brailsford.</p>

<p>"You're ... you're wonderful, Mrs. Brailsford,"
the girl had told her one afternoon when
they were alone in the kitchen fixing supper. "It
just seems like you're the kindest thing in God's
world. I wish I <i>could</i> be your daughter like you
said."</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">When the bins of barley, wheat and oats were
full to overflowing and the thrashing crew had
moved on to the Bussey farm, Stud found that
work was slack for a moment, and he decided to
take a little journey.</p>

<p>He filled the gasoline tank of his Ford from
the big, red barrel mounted on sawhorses beside
the milk house, poured two quarts of thick green
oil into the engine, and emptied most of a sprinkling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
can of water into the ever-thirsty radiator.</p>

<p>Four new tires were lashed to starboard and
port. Pumps, jacks, kits of tools, tire shoes, and
extra inner tubes were stowed beneath seats and in
tool boxes. Stud had lunch enough for a two-weeks'
journey, and at Sarah's insistence a
sweater, raincoat, rubbers, and three changes of
shirts and underwear. He felt as adventurous as
Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>Sarah waved until he was out of sight down
the road, and returned to the kitchen biting her
lip to keep back the tears. While Stud, racing
along at twenty miles an hour through the dewy
August morning, felt as fit as a fiddle and as
cocky as a bantam rooster.</p>

<p>He noticed the fine new circular barn Ed
Underwood was building upon the very site
where two previous circular barns had been struck
by lightning and burned to the ground. Just flying
up in the face of providence to build another
of those queer-shaped cow sheds on the same
spot. He craned his neck to look over the high
board fence at the Foote place where all the
machinery stood rusting in the front yard. He
could see that Cyrus Babcock's bull wouldn't
furnish much competition for his Napoleon at
the county fair that year. Cy took too much stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in this scientific stuff his son was learning at the
University of Wisconsin. Science was all right in
its place but&mdash;</p>

<p>"You gotta have a feel for raising cattle same
as for playing the fiddle," Stud told the passing
scenery.</p>

<p>He was genuinely glad to see that the Widow
Morrison had a fine stand of tobacco and that
One Arm Bert Howe had the best corn in miles.
It was pretty tough about Bert and his tubercular
girl.</p>

<p>The creek at Busseyville, meandering through
its wide valley, looked so inviting that Stud drove
his car in among the willows, kicked through a
meadow of deep grass and dusty milkweed bloom
on which the big, brown butterflies were gathered,
and came at last to the deep hole at the bend
where he had often gone swimming as a boy.</p>

<p>There was not a farm woman in sight, so Stud
stripped, took a running dive, and sported in the
cool, clear water. How fine it felt! He blew and
bubbled, tried to swim to the bottom of the
twelve foot hole and pick up pebbles, opened his
eyes under the water and grabbed for the silver
minnows with his big hands. Out again with the
wind and sun upon his body! Into his clothes
and back to the car where he sampled a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
chicken sandwiches and drank noisily from the
artesian well beside the road.</p>

<p>Another ten miles of hard driving over wagon
roads which followed the ridge to the west of the
lake, then into Fort Atkinson and on up the Rock
River Valley. On either side spread the fertile
black acres which had brought thousands of eager
immigrants from across the sea. The sons and
grandsons of the pioneers were thrashing grain
and sweating in the fields.</p>

<p>Stud marveled when he thought how rapidly
he was traversing these miles which would have
taken days by ox-cart. Not a blowout, as yet,
and not a broken spring. No trouble with the
magneto, carburettor, or the engine.</p>

<p>Until he was twenty miles from home Stud
would not let himself think what it was which
had brought him on this wild goose chase. It
sobered him when he remembered.</p>

<p>From the moment on that June night when
Sarah had asked if Early Ann might be his
daughter the simple mind of Stud Brailsford had
been troubled and perplexed. He wanted to ask
the girl outright what she knew about her mother
but was embarrassed before her. He tried to
recall each of the girls with whom he had had
secret pleasure before he married Sarah. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
it dawned upon him that Early Ann Sherman
was undoubtedly the daughter of Tess
Bedermier,&mdash;Tess, the girl with whom he had
once gone swimming naked in Lake Koshkonong
in the days when to even speak of a girl's legs
was to risk an eternity in hell. It was a Sunday
evening at that. He was supposed to be driving
her to the evening services at the Methodist
Episcopal church in Brailsford Junction.</p>

<p>Tess, the lovely and lost, the foolhardy and
independent, the talk of the Ladies' Aid and the
scandal of the countryside. She had been Doc
Crandall's stylish hired girl during the last two
years of the veterinarian's life. Of an age with
Temperance and Sarah, Tess had been the most
run-after girl in town during the years of 1890
and '91.</p>

<p>Stud had not told Sarah of his discovery, nor
why, when looking into Early Ann's face, he
was suddenly shocked (seeing the living, breathing
image of Tess).</p>

<p>But could she be his daughter?</p>

<p>Maybe she was older than she would admit.
If she were twenty-one, for instance....</p>

<p>He tried to analyze what it was that disturbed
him and decided that if a man sees his daughter
growing up from babyhood, perhaps helps to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
tend her, plays with her, teaches her to ride
horseback and to swim; if he watches her sprouting
up to young womanhood, sees her put up her
hair and wear her first long skirts, then he can
think of her as his daughter and not be troubled
with her pretty ways and her fresh young body.</p>

<p>But if it should happen that a father did not
see his daughter even once in her life before she
became a young woman, then he might be disturbed
by her prettiness, seeing in her, her mother
of years gone by.</p>

<p>It was not like Stud to be worrying about
anything except possibly the crops and the stock.
He took the world as he found it and found it
good. He lived moment by moment and day by
day and rested on Sunday.</p>

<p>But here was a new and troubling element in
his life; a worry, and a dumb, sweet misery which
he carried about with him, so that sometimes Gus
would have to ask him twice if he had ordered
more bran, or if he intended to send for that new
belt for the gas engine in the milk house, before
Stud was aware Gus was speaking.</p>

<p>He thought of it as he went down into the
woods with Shep to bring home the cows, and
he thought of it while he was topping the tobacco,
breaking off the budding white flowers to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the plants from spindling up and going to seed.
He carried his troubles with him into the barns
and the haymow, to the table and to bed.</p>

<p>Was it likely that she was eighteen and not his
daughter? Or was she, perhaps, twenty-one, and
the child he had got on Tess Bedermier that
moonlight night they had bathed in the lake and
afterwards gone back among the willows?</p>

<p>He did not know where Tess had gone that
autumn. She had quarreled with him and moved
away from Brailsford Junction. He wondered
if she had ever married, and if she were living
now. He thought he would never be satisfied
until he found her and asked about Early Ann.</p>

<p>But to find her would be a job of clever sleuthing
for which Stud felt too big and clumsy. He
called on his friend Timothy Halleck in whom
he placed utmost faith. Halleck went to Madison
to look for a marriage certificate. He came back
puzzled and no wiser.</p>

<p>He wrote to the only Bedermier he knew, a
second cousin of Tess's living in Chicago, but
found that this distant relative had not heard of
Tess in more than twenty years.</p>

<p>Then he went to Old Mrs. Crandall who
seemed inclined to confide a secret, but changed
her mind and shut her mouth like a clam. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
last, having had a real inspiration, he visited Mrs.
Marsden, Early Ann's erstwhile landlady, and
asked about the girl's mail.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare insinuate I look in other
people's envelopes," squeaked Mrs. Marsden.
"But I did notice the three letters she got were
postmarked from Horicon, Wisconsin."</p>

<p>This was the only clew which Halleck could
offer his friend, but it was sufficient.</p>

<p>As Stud followed the Rock River toward its
source he watched the stream grow smaller and
smaller. He passed through Jefferson and Watertown,
neat towns in the midst of prosperous
country. On every side were the white-washed
milk houses and bright red barns of thrifty German
farmers. The corn rustled, windmills
whirred, and bob-o-links scattered their liquid
notes. He passed busy creameries, a brewery, and
a cross-road store, and still his chariot wheeled on.</p>

<p>But as he climbed a hill giving a view of the
rich valley and miles of winding river, a tire
expired with a long, soft sigh; and it was an hour
later after a mortal struggle with tire irons, pump,
jack, and obstinate valve-stems, that he was on
his way again. Soon after the engine coughed
and died. He was out of gas.</p>

<p>Courteous drivers of that all but forgotten era<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
when a Ford was a fraternal emblem more binding
than a Masonic button drew up with boiling
radiators and shrieking brakes to shout, "Need a
lift, friend?" It was one of these cheerful fellow
motorists who drove him three miles and back
for a gallon of gasoline.</p>

<p>He stopped over night at a farm where the
big German farmer and his apple-dumpling wife
would have been ashamed to even think of
charging for their hospitality. He was impressed
by the clean barns and white-washed trees, and
spent several hours with the genial farmer examining
his Holsteins.</p>

<p>The next day he drove on to Horicon.</p>

<p>He came at last to the desolate marshes which
seem to stretch interminably across the wide valley
of the upper reaches of the Rock,&mdash;endless
channels and pools, acres of billowing swamp
grass, millions of yellow pond lilies, red-wing
blackbirds chattering in hordes upon the swaying
cat-tails.</p>

<p>Asking for Sherman, for Bedermier, and for
Sherman again and hearing this and that disturbing
bit of their history until at last he knew the
whole sordid tale, he made his way along one of
the most desolate roads he had ever traversed.
Huts among the gravel hills bordering the marsh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
were over-run with chickens, pigs, and dirty children.
Pot-bellied women came to the door to
see him pass.</p>

<p>He lost his way during the afternoon and had
to retrace his path over ruts and ditches which
threatened at every moment to break a spring.
Toward sunset he arrived at the deserted Sherman
place and drove in through the stumps of a once
generous orchard where wheel-less wagons, overturned
plows, and rusty cultivators vied with
sagging fences to make the spot as uninviting as
can be imagined.</p>

<p>There was scarcely an unbroken window left
in the ramshackle farmhouse; the windmill was
down. Plantain and burrs had crept into the
barnyard, and the fields were giving way on
every hand to brambles, sumac and willows.</p>

<p>So this was where Tess Bedermier had come,
pregnant with his child, to live with the only man
who would take her in, to bury that first child in
an unmarked grave, and to bear Bung Sherman
three children out of wedlock, of whom Early
Ann alone had survived. Here was the desolate
farm on which Early Ann&mdash;no child of Stud's&mdash;had
grown and blossomed, and it was here that
Bung Sherman had died in a drunken brawl with
a duck hunter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>After Bung's death Tess had gone off with a
man who stopped at the farm for a drink of
water, a man whose name was unknown to the
neighbors and whose only distinguishing characteristic
was that he carried in the crook of his arm
a large black cat. Two weeks later Early Ann had
gone to join them.</p>

<p>As Stud watched the sun setting over the vast
marshes he thought he felt a cold wind blow
across the barn lot, and the hair stood up on the
nape of his neck. The killdeers called that a storm
was at hand. Clouds rolled up from the horizon
and distant thunder rattled like wheels on a far
bridge. Then, suddenly, the sky was black and
over-cast. The lightning flashed close at hand,&mdash;jagged
blue, reflected on the dark pools and the
channels. The trees bowed low, the dust whirled,
and rain came down over countless miles of marsh
land.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pn p1">When Stud returned from Horicon there was
little time to think of Tess, Early Ann, Sarah, or
any other woman for the farm was up to its ears
in preparation for the Rock County Fair. Three
magnificent stud animals were to be entered: Napoleon,
the bull; Teddy Roosevelt, the stallion;
and Ulysses S. Grant, the boar.</p>

<p>Napoleon, the dark and silky black Jersey
bull, whose pedigree covered several pages and
included such ancestors as Imperial Delight, sired
by Royal Edward out of Queen of the Channel
Islands, looked every bit an aristocrat. National
and international prize-winning blood ran in his
veins. Mothers and grandmothers with amazing
udders were listed on his family tree, and two
or three of his bovine ancestors had sailed from
the Isle of Jersey on a cattle boat named the
<i>Mayflower</i>. With massive head and fiery eyes,
he seemed to challenge the whole world to battle.
In reality he was as gentle as a lamb and loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to be scratched behind the ears with a corn cob.</p>

<p>As for Teddy Roosevelt, the Percheron stallion,
with arching neck and melodramatic proportions,
undoubtedly the blood of medieval
chargers ran in his veins. Sired by the pride of
Normandy, and himself the sire of scores of the
finest Percherons in Southern Wisconsin, he
walked as though a golden armored youth were
on his back and plumes behind his ears.</p>

<p>Finally there was Ulysses S. Grant, the mettlesome
and vicious Poland China boar, who was
growing more temperamental daily about his
highly commercial amours. Stud often threatened
to turn this valuable piece of breeding
machinery into second rate ham and bacon, for
as sure as some admiring farmer came ten miles
with a seductive and highly amenable sow,
Ulysses would sulk in his private bath of mud,
capricious as a Roman emperor. There was no
accounting for his taste which was usually plebeian.</p>

<p>But to the judges at the county fair, Ulysses
was annually the sweetest thing on cloven hooves.
Manicured and groomed as he always was, his
pink snout pointed at a most entrancing angle,
his tightly curled tail and glowing bristles the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
picture of health and good breeding, this porcine
Apollo usually won in a walk.</p>

<p>"All personality and no character," was the
way Stud fondly put it.</p>

<p>Although a cholera epidemic was rampant that
summer, and Gus with pardonable pessimism
predicted that Ulysses would contract the disease
from sheer pig-headedness, no such thing occurred.
He did acquire a singular case of temperament,
however.</p>

<p>Like the other animals which were to be entered
Ulysses was brushed, beautified and pampered
for days preceding the fair, and in former
years he had seemed to enjoy not only the extra
corn but the effortless scratching. This year,
however, he squealed with rage whenever Stud
entered the pen, gleamed wickedly at his trainers
out of small, blood-shot eyes, and more than once
tried to annihilate his owner.</p>

<p>The boar's private quarters were closed off from
the main pig pen by a stout, narrow gate through
which one entered at his own risk. One day when
Stud brought Sarah down to observe how beautifully
the boar was pointing up, he started into
the inner pen and was charged by the infuriated
animal. Brailsford took one step backward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
tripped over a trough, and falling struck his head
on a stone. The next moment the boar was upon
him.</p>

<p>Sarah seized a five-pronged manure fork which
was leaning against the fence and drove it with
all her strength into the shoulder of the boar,
turning him at the crucial moment.</p>

<p>Stud leapt to his feet, one arm bleeding, and
despite Sarah's cry of warning plunged barehanded
into the fight. He kicked the great
ringed nose again and again with his heavy boot,
grabbed a large hind leg for a brief but titanic
struggle to drag the beast back into his pen, at
last drove him through the gate with a piece of
two-by-four.</p>

<p>Gus and Early Ann came running. Sarah
managed to use the pitch fork effectively from the
top of the fence. But Stud motioned them all
away. This was now his fight and he wanted to
handle it alone.</p>

<p>To their cries that he come away Stud turned
a deaf ear. Years of pent up fury went into the
struggle. The boar was blind with rage yet
respectful of the giant with his heavy stick. The
man was filled with righteous anger against this
stubborn beast and ready for a showdown. They
fought and maneuvered, charged and leapt aside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the man shouting incoherently, the big animal
squealing and tearing up the earth.</p>

<p>"I'll fix the bastard," Stud cried. His shirt
was ripped. His muscles knotted and gleaming.</p>

<p>Again and again the boar charged and went
crashing into the fence as Stud scrambled to
safety. And time after time Stud brought the
two-by-four crashing down between the maddened
animal's eyes.</p>

<p>At last they were both too tired to fight. The
boar lay squealing and panting in impotent rage
across the pen, while Stud, proud that he could
walk from the arena, smiled as he climbed the
fence.</p>

<p>"Well, there's one blue ribbon gone to holy
blazes," said Gus. "But by golly it was worth it."</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">The fight with the boar had two immediate
consequences: Sarah suffered a nervous collapse,
and Ulysses S. Grant, although carefully tended,
proved conclusively that he would not be prize-winning
material for the fall of 1913.</p>

<p>It was the veterinarian who was called first
and later the family doctor.</p>

<p>"Now don't you worry about me," Sarah said.
"I'm all right. You just take care of Ulysses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
go on getting ready for the fair. I don't need to
go this year."</p>

<p>"Why, I couldn't go without you, Mother,"
Stud said, "and ... and without Ulysses."</p>

<p>Old Doc Carlyle, the vet who had tended
Ulysses ever since he was a small, squealing red
suckling, shook his head sadly. He had a genuine
fondness for the vicious old boar and had always
claimed that he would make blue ribbon material.</p>

<p>"You hadn't ought to beat no dumb animal
like you beat Ulysses," he told Stud. "It ain't
Christian."</p>

<p>The less efficient and far more callous general
practitioner, Doctor Whitehead, who came to see
Sarah, took her pulse with his inch-thick stem-winder
and as usual lost count at eleven. He took
her temperature with a thermometer which had
not been properly sterilized in three years, and
looked down her throat with a spoon.</p>

<p>He pooh-poohed her fear that she had been
internally injured during the fight with the boar.</p>

<p>"Probably some female ailment," he insisted,
shaking several harmless pink powders onto
papers which he folded deftly and left upon the
dresser. "You ain't bad off. You'll be up and
around in no time."</p>

<p>Sarah watched a spider making his web in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
corner of the ceiling. She continued to watch him
long after the doctor's Ford could no longer be
heard down the road.</p>

<p>"Spin your pretty web," she told him. "I
won't brush it down. I'm just going to let myself
be sick. I reckon I got a right to lie back and be
sick one time in my life."</p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Stud tried to straighten his back at the end of
the row. The sweat poured from his temples and
the grizzled creases of his stubbled cheeks. The
pain went in wide, flat bands down the heavy
muscles on either side of his spine.</p>

<p>It was weakness to show this pain. One must
laugh, throw down the shining tobacco hatchet
beside the shagbark hickory, snatch up the heavy,
brown-earthenware jug, tip it deftly over the
shoulder and slosh long, cool swigs of cider down
one's parched and dusty throat.</p>

<p>"Uuufff, Uuuggg," said the big tobacco harvester,
wiping his mouth with the back of his
sleeve and spitting into the dust. "Sure tastes
good, don't it?"</p>

<p>"Fair to middling," said Gus.</p>

<p>"It's darn good cider," said Ansel Ottermann,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
"even iffen it is full of rotten apples and worms
and such."</p>

<p>"Don't need to drink no more than you like,"
said Stud, holding the jug just out of Ansel's
reach. "Is it good cider or ain't it?"</p>

<p>"It's good cider," Ansel said.</p>

<p>The almanac had predicted early frost that
year, and although the entire family scoffed at
almanac predictions Stud had cleaned and sharpened
his tobacco axes, suckered his tobacco plants,
cleaned out the sheds and gathered together a
crew.</p>

<p>On the stroke of six one hazy blue Indian
summer morning the noisy crowd of farmers and
men from Brailsford Junction began the backbreaking
labor. Up one row and down the next
went the sweating workers. The left hand grasped
the stalk, the right sent the tobacco hatchet
cleanly through the heavy-fibered stem. Flash,
flash went the bright steel in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Great crop this year," said Vern Barton.
"Just heft them stalks."</p>

<p>"Too darned good a crop," growled Gus. "I
got a crick in my back like a he-dog in April."</p>

<p>"That's what you get gallivantin' around
nights," said Stud. The men laughed.</p>

<p>"How you do talk," said Gus. "You know I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
ain't took a girl into a haymow for twenty years."</p>

<p>"How about a cornfield?" Stud asked.</p>

<p>Laths tipped with steel were spudded through
the butt ends of the stalks&mdash;five or six plants to
each lath. The tobacco was then loaded upon
wagons and hauled to the sheds. Men climbed
nimbly among the poles hanging the heavily
laden laths, tier upon tier. The hot, suffocating
air was pungent with the smell of green tobacco.</p>

<p>The thick, moss-green leaves were soft and
heavy as velvet to the touch. Later they would be
brown and brittle. Still later, when to the vast
excitement of the countryside "case" weather
began, they would be fine and pliable as thin
brown leather.</p>

<p>The swallows had gathered long weeks before,
and, as though at some invisible signal sent along
the thousands of miles of wire on which they
were mobilized, had left over night for the south.
The fields were strewn with yellowing pumpkins
and swelling hubbard squashes, knobbed, burly,
and deep green. The first ducks were dropping
in from the north. Soon it would be time for the
Rock County Fair.</p>

<p>As fair week approached, however, Stud announced
his decision to remain at home. He
declared that since Ulysses and Sarah were both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
laid up, Peter still thrashing, and Early Ann of
necessity tied to the housework, he too would
pass up the event of the year.</p>

<p>He looked over the fence into the pen of
Ulysses S. Grant and shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"We're just a couple of darned old fools!"</p>

<p>"Oink," said the boar.</p>

<p>"First fair you and me have missed in five
years."</p>

<p>The boar sighed gustily and lay down in his
consoling bath of mud.</p>

<p>Stud helped Gus give the bull and stallion
their final beauty treatments, loaded the big bull
into the wagon, and hitched the Percheron on
behind. Early Ann gave the bow of blue ribbon
on the stallion's tail a final twist and pat. Stud
slipped Gus a twenty dollar bill. And off went
the shining green wagon, its bright yellow wheels
looking like huge sunflowers as they flashed in
the sunlight. The tug links played a merry tune,
the stallion whinnied gently, while Stud and
Early Ann cheered the debonair farm hand on his
way.</p>

<p>"You better bring home some cups and ribbons,"
Early Ann called after the retreating
cavalcade.</p>

<p>"Trust me," shouted Gus, waving his derby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl and man stood as if entranced until
they could no longer hear the rattle of the
wagon, and until the dust had settled on the roadway.</p>

<h3 class="p2">4</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Sarah continued to feel ailing despite pink
powders, herb tea, and a highly advertised variety
of vegetable compound.</p>

<p>The work was thrown completely upon the
shoulders of Early Ann. Stud would have been
blind not to have noticed how well she bore up
under this burden and how gladly she cared for
Sarah. The girl could cook as fine a meal as he
had ever tasted, and be as gay and fresh after
hours over the cook stove as when she came
clicking down the stairs with the chamber pots at
four in the morning.</p>

<p>She never asked Stud to kill chickens for her.
She went to the chicken house herself, chased
down a pair of plump friers, and chopped off their
heads without more ado. These she scalded,
plucked, singed, drew, washed in cold well water,
rolled in egg and flour, and fried to a crisp golden
brown. It made Stud's mouth fairly water to
think of those chicken dinners: hot biscuits,
mashed potatoes, lots of chicken gravy, coffee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with Jersey cream, and hot mince pie for dessert.</p>

<p>Such roasts, fries and stews! Such homemade
bread, dumplings, pies and cakes! Her cooking
was better than hotel dinners, Stud averred.
There was a tang to everything she cooked and
everything she did.</p>

<p>Stud had never before been completely aware
of the work a woman must do around a farm.
He had rather thought that Sarah was having the
best of the bargain all these years. Now, perversely,
he was conscious of every task a farm-wife
must perform.</p>

<p>He noticed how from Monday morning when
she started pumping cistern water for the week's
washing, until Saturday night when she put over
water for baths Early Ann never sat down to rest.
He noticed particularly how clean she kept the
house and milk house; how shining and sweet-smelling
were the milk pails and separator; how
the meals were always on the dot and the dishes
cleared away promptly after the meal. She
canned, churned, carried in cords of wood.</p>

<p>Stud found himself wondering if there were
not some way to heat flatirons save over a roaring
cook stove. Somehow the mountains of dishes
seemed unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>But Early Ann did not complain. She sang
as she worked.</p>

<p>Watching her now, as with hair and dress
blowing she fed five hundred snowy chickens,
Stud told himself she was a "darned good hired
girl and would make some lucky fellow a good
wife."</p>

<p>The phone rang two longs and three shorts
the following Saturday. It was Gus calling jubilantly
from Janesville. He had squandered a
quarter to inform the family that Napoleon was
not only the greatest <i>Jersey</i> bull in the county,
but, according to the judges who awarded him a
silver loving cup, the greatest bull of <i>any</i> variety.
Teddy, the stallion, had won a blue ribbon, while
Sarah's raspberry preserves had been judged the
best in their class. Peter's pumpkin was three
pounds and four ounces heavier than its nearest
rival, and Gus had won a kewpie doll for
Early Ann by hitting a nigger baby with a baseball.</p>

<p>Stud could hear the subdued exclamations
from every kitchen on the party line.</p>

<p>"But I didn't get nothing in the wood-chopping
contest," Gus complained. "I got licked
seven-ways-for-Sunday by a lady from East Fulton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The family celebrated with homemade ice
cream eaten in Sarah's bedroom.</p>

<p>That evening at dusk a storm arose. Lightning
quivered along the horizon, and a wind sprang
up. Early Ann, throwing her apron over her head
to protect it from the spattering drops, hurried
down to the old mill to get in a late brood of
chicks raised by the fierce old one-legged hen who
every summer stole her nest.</p>

<p>As she reached the doorway of the mill Joe
Valentine grabbed her around the waist and put
a large, hairy hand over her mouth. He pulled
her into the dark building and began talking to
her in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"You're my step daughter," he said. "You're
coming with me."</p>

<p>She bit his fingers in fury and cried out for
help, but the moaning of the wind and the rush
of the rain muffled her words. She forgot all the
nice ways and pretty talk she had learned from
Sarah Brailsford and kicked and fought and
swore.</p>

<p>"I'll scratch your eyes out, Joe!"</p>

<p>"You're my girl. You ran away from me."
He nursed his bitten hand.</p>

<p>"I'll tell everybody how you treated Maw."</p>

<p>"Come along now." He tried to pull her toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the door, then stopped. "I was good to your
maw," he said.</p>

<p>"You killed her," the girl cried. "You made
her take in washings, and ... and worse."</p>

<p>"You can't teach an old cat new tricks."</p>

<p>"You killed her," Early Ann shouted.</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth, you little bastard," Joe
said.</p>

<p>He tried to kiss her and she began to fight
again. He slapped her face methodically a dozen
times.</p>

<p>"You're my girl," Joe said. "You're my step
daughter, and you ain't eighteen yet."</p>

<p>"I am eighteen," she panted. "Let me go,
Joe." She sunk her teeth into his arm while he
screamed.</p>

<p>"Now you're going to get it," he said. He
ripped her dress and bent her backward until she
thought he would break her back. Then she went
limp and did not fight any more, but nothing happened.
A moment later he flung her away.</p>

<p>"You ain't any good to me, either," he said
with a great, wistful sigh. She saw his face in a
flash of lightning. There was no lust there nor
anger. A cat rubbed against her leg purring
loudly.</p>

<p>She went out past the man who did not try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
stop her. She hurried through the rain toward
the hollow of lantern light which was approaching.</p>

<p>"Are you all right, Early Ann?" Stud cried. He
came running and held up the lantern to look at
her. He saw the torn dress and disheveled hair.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" he cried. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You know, but you won't tell."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He pushed past her angrily and went into the
mill holding the lantern high. He snatched up a
piece of iron pipe and plunged through the dark
rooms shouting. A cat rubbed against him, a big
black fellow. Stud heard laughter out in the
storm, hurried out into the rain, but could find
no one.</p>

<p>In the kitchen once more he threw off his wet
jacket, hung up the lantern, took Early Ann by
the shoulders and tried to make her meet his
eyes.</p>

<p>"You're not my daughter," he said. "I ... I
could...."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Brailsford, please!" She was crying
quietly.</p>

<p>He let his hands drop from her shoulders,
turned and looked out through the black, dripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
window toward the lake. He could hear the
waves rushing up on the shore and breaking, the
wind soughing through the elms and maples. He
thought of Sarah lying pale and weak on her bed,
and he thought of the robust girl standing in the
lamp light behind him.</p>

<p>Very deliberately he left the kitchen and
climbed the narrow, dark stairs to his bed.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>In the early autumn of 1913 a French flyer
looped the loop to the amazement of an incredulous
world. More troops were ordered to the
Mexican border. In Chicago the Bon Ton girls
were the last word in burlesque. Smart horses
wore bobbed tails and well-cropped manes. Forty-four
thousand eight hundred tons of dynamite
tore away the barrier at the Pacific end of the
Panama Canal while Shriners cheered. Prime
favorites on the piano rolls were "Good-bye
Boys," "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine" and
"You're a Great Big Blue-Eyed Baby." Wheat
sold at around ninety cents in Chicago with hogs
close to nine dollars. Aunt Martha of the Needle
Notes column found that one could cut whalebone
to any desired length by warming it first
before the fire. German and American yachts
raced off Marblehead, and Lieutenant Governor
Thomas Morris of Wisconsin told an attentive
audience that never again would his fair state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
become a coaling station for Wall Street, nor a
water tank for the Rockefeller and Morgan interests.</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">But to Peter Brailsford, impatient with his
youth; torn with fear of God, of hell, and of sex;
romantic, inexperienced, wistful; anxious to get
ahead in the world, yet essentially unworldly; intolerant,
rebellious, headstrong; filled with hatreds,
jealousies, and a morbid interest in death;
saddled with concepts of duty, patriotism, and
courage which were fatal to millions of his generation;
big, clumsy, lovable; obsessed with the
idea that he was only a country boy; almost as
supersensitive as Sarah and nearly as lusty as
Stud; fine, intelligent, mechanically minded, and
above all a considerate and good hearted young
fellow....</p>

<p>To this healthy but unhappy product of English
ancestry, Methodist theology, and the American
public school system the tumult of the outer
world meant little compared to the tumult within
his brain.</p>

<p>Now, striding along Main Street in greasy
coveralls, glowering at the Saturday afternoon
sun through eyes dark with anger, kicking defiantly
through drifts of yellow elm leaves, flaunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
rebellion and stubborn pride at every step,
he was just a kid coming home from work at the
"Trailer" to those he met; but to himself, Peter
was quite naturally the center of the Universe.</p>

<p>He would show the world and particularly
Mike O'Casey and the front office gang what sort
of a boy they had greasing their trailers. He
would invent some new and world-revolutionizing
trailer which would make them pop-eyed with
amazement. And when he had been made vice-president
of the company he would call Bud
Spillman into his office and dismiss him with
great dignity.</p>

<p>Peter told himself that he was talking nonsense
and acting like an unbroken yearling. He knew
that he should be the happiest boy in the world
and should thank God for his good fortune.
Nevertheless as he elbowed his way through
clots of gossiping farmers whose rigs and Fords
lined Main Street he knew that he was far from
being happy.</p>

<p>Maybe life in town wasn't so perfect after all.
Perhaps after he had taken a crack at this trailer
job.... But no. He would never go back to
the farm. Not even if he could be thrashing
boss every year with twenty men under him. He
would stick it out greasing trailers until the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
he died. Bud Spillman or anyone else couldn't
whip Peter Brailsford.</p>

<p>He stopped before the Bentley Brothers'
Hardware store, irrepressibly drawn by the beautiful
stag and pearl-handled jack-knives in the
window, and remembered the jack-knife he had
stolen from a boy at country school and how he
had known that God had seen him steal the knife,
and how for days he went in constant dread that
God would strike him dead for his sin. He still
had an overwhelming desire for pearl-handled
jack-knives. He remembered how he had thought
that eternal damnation was not too great a
price to pay for that shining knife, which was
as cool and smooth as slippery elm between his
fingers.</p>

<p>Looking in at the hardware store window cluttered
with milk pails, muskrat traps, fish poles,
pitchforks and spades he suddenly caught sight
of his own offensive image in the glass: ears that
stuck out on either side of his head like sails, a
thatch of dark, unruly curls which would never
stay combed, big brown calf's eyes which might
have graced a Jersey heifer, and pouting lips.</p>

<p>He wondered how anyone could look so ugly.
"What you need," he said irrelevantly, "is a
good swift kick in the pants." Undoubtedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
with a face like that, he was getting more than
he deserved from a most generous world.</p>

<p>He began to count his blessings, unconvinced
but hopeful. He was away from the farm at last,
had freedom, a job, and a room in town. His
third weekly paycheck of twenty-two dollars and
fifty cents was in his pocket. He had a girl who
some day might give him a kiss, and a dapper
little employer, Mike O'Casey, whom he admired
beyond all power of expression.</p>

<p>Still he was miserable.</p>

<p>The very eminence of O'Casey was deflating
to Peter. How could a country lout with big feet
and clumsy red hands ever hope to reach such
pinnacles of success? The president of O'Casey
Trailers was not only a man of the world, a fine
mechanic, an inventor of proven genius, a baritone
soloist, and a buck and wing dancer. He
was also the most popular and best dressed man
in town. Peter bet that nobody in New York's
Four Hundred was better looking or a classier
dresser.</p>

<p>The boy leaned against the hitching rail and
sighed as his hero went roaring past in his big
red car with cutout open. Peter wished that Mr.
O'Casey would turn and nod, but no such miracle
occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter asked himself what he was mooning
about. But he knew all too well. Bud Spillman,
out of all the hundreds of thousands of possible
men, had been made his straw-boss at the
"Trailer." Peter remembered once when he was
going to kill Bud Spillman. He had waited for
hours behind the Methodist church with a piece
of pipe. He had stood all that he could possibly
stand from the bully, had been kicked in the
stomach when he was down, had been insulted in
the showers before all the other boys, had had
his clothes tied in knots in the locker room, and
his tennis shoes filled with tacks.</p>

<p class="b1">He had stood in the cold behind the Methodist
church waiting for Spillman who usually took
that short cut home. He had envisioned just how
the bully would look when he lay there pale and
dead, and he had planned all his own actions:
what he would do if he were chased, and where
he would jump the freight which was to take
him from Brailsford Junction forever. A wishful
little song from childhood echoed and re-echoed
in his brain:</p>

<p class="ppq20">"<i>Moonlight, starlight,<br />
I guess the bears ain't out tonight.</i>"</p>

<p class="p1">But Bud had gone home another way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, out of all the possible fellows in
Brailsford Junction, Bud Spillman had been
made his straw-boss. Bud, his rival for Maxine,
and his instinctive enemy since childhood.</p>

<p>Ruthaford S. Spillman, Bud's father, and
owner of the biggest livery stable in Brailsford
Junction had been one of the twenty backers
who had put up money with which O'Casey had
built his factory. It had been a snap for Bud to
get the job.</p>

<p>Peter's adventure had started so auspiciously
that he could scarcely believe this new turn of
events. He had come steaming into town sixty
miles an hour on his motorcycle, dressed in his
best serge suit and wearing his brightest tie.
After an hour of agony and anticipation he had
been ushered into the awe-inspiring offices of
president Mike O'Casey.</p>

<p>"Know anything about trailers?" asked
O'Casey.</p>

<p>"No, but I could learn."</p>

<p>"Is that your motorcycle out in front?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"Can you take'er apart and put'er together?"</p>

<p>"You're darned right I can ... I mean, yes
sir. And I know all about Fords and thrashing
machines."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. O'Casey smiled at the serious, eager young
man before him.</p>

<p>"I'm seventeen going on eighteen," Peter said.</p>

<p>"I guess you'll do, Kid."</p>

<p>Peter walked out, floating on air.</p>

<p>He started work the next morning and was
temporarily assigned to the paint shop where a
shipment of the crude semi-trailers of that day,
based on the early Martin patents, were being
painted a snowy white for a Chicago milk company.
He was clever with a brush and soon acquired
the knack of enameling and varnishing
without leaving a sag or a brush mark. All went
well until the second week when Bud Spillman
came to work at the "Trailer." From that moment
on Peter was miserable.</p>

<p>"So you wanted a job as a mechanic?" asked
Bud. "I'll see what I can do."</p>

<p>Several days later Peter was transferred to the
assembly plant where from morning until night
he greased trailers and plant machinery. Bud
promised to have him cleaning out toilets and
spittoons by the end of the month.</p>

<p>To hell with all of them! Some day Brailsford
Junction would wake up to the fact that Peter
was a genius. They would go around telling
anecdotes of his youth, and laugh about the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
he quit school, told "Indian Face" Bolton where
he could go, and tossed his school books into the
creek. He would invent an "equalizer" to take
the "whip" out of the action between car and
trailer. He would make a half a million dollars
and would live in a large house on Shannon's
Hill with Maxine Larabee and their many children.</p>

<p>The day began to brighten all about him as he
dreamed. The farmers and their wives looked
more kindly, the girls more handsome and the
men more noble. By the time Peter had reached
the Brailsford Junction National Bank he was
noticing how blue the sky seemed overhead, how
bright the leaves, how keen the wood-smoke in the
air. Not even the appearance of the prissy Mr.
Clarence Bolton, principal of the Brailsford Junction
high school of recent and unpleasant memory
could take the sunshine out of this newly discovered
Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Peter stopped to admire a brace of mallards
which Hank Vetter the butcher was just taking
from his Ford roadster. Hank said that in his
opinion Mike O'Casey was a card and highly
worthy of the admiration of every young man in
town. In front of the pool hall, men sat on the
hitching rail watching the farm girls go by. Cats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
dreamed happily on piles of fresh vegetables in
the grocery store windows. The loafers sitting on
the steps of the cigar store spat idly at the wooden
Indian.</p>

<p>In Peter's new frame of mind even Old Man
Mulroy who was teaching his bow-legged grandson
to say "God damn" before a highly appreciative
male audience in front of the livery stable,
was mildly amusing on this day.</p>

<p>"Dod damn," said the toddler.</p>

<p>The men slapped their thighs and guffawed.</p>

<p>Old Man Mulroy, drooling tobacco juice at the
corners of his toothless mouth, grinned slyly.</p>

<p>A job in town. A paycheck in his pocket. The
boy whistled gayly as he marched along.</p>

<p>He looked in over the swinging half-doors of
the Red Moon Bar and felt that the time would
never come when he would be twenty-one and
could stand with one foot on the brass rail and
drink with the rest of the men. A new and brilliant
bock-beer billy goat was charging out of a
sign on the back wall. A large red bull, and a
superior cowboy rolling a cigarette with one hand
advertised a well-known brand of cigarette tobacco.</p>

<p>Peter wished that he dared to smoke on the
street. He wished quite violently that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
roll a cigarette with one hand like the superior
cowboy in the picture.</p>

<p>He paused before the Palace theater where he
examined the bright billboards displaying a serial
queen poised in midair between precipice and
precipice, another view of the same harassed
young woman to whom the villain was touching
a torch, while the hero of the affair looked on
calmly from his rearing mount.</p>

<p>Life was very full and romantic, thought Peter
Brailsford. He realized that he could see every
movie that came to Brailsford Junction without
making the least impression upon his nearly inexhaustible
weekly stipend. He could even buy
himself a new suit and some dazzling new ties.</p>

<p>A room of his own, no school work. He could
skip church and Sunday School if he wished.</p>

<p>But no, he could not. A momentary cloud
passed over his sunny landscape as Peter came
abreast of the Dingle Brothers' General Store
into which Temperance Crandall was just disappearing.
He really liked the fussy creature even
if she did make him go to church, knit him wristlets
which he dared not wear and equally dared
not refuse, brought him soapstones on chilly autumn
nights, and saw that his flannel nightgown
was warmed before the base burner before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
went to bed. But he did wish that she would be
a little less curious as to where he went evenings
and what time he got in.</p>

<p>Rooms were scarce in Brailsford Junction with
the "Trailer" booming. Peter had taken what he
could get. He could abide the games of Authors
and Flinch played with Temperance and her
mother in the latter's upstairs bedroom, with the
oil heater making weird patterns of light and
shadow on the ceiling, and the kerosene lamp
spluttering. But he did not like to be crossquestioned
about Maxine Larabee.</p>

<p>"Maxine Larabee!" He rolled the syllables
over his tongue and felt the excitement that even
her name produced. How delicate and fine and
unattainable she was. He felt like a great clumsy
oaf beside her. He felt as awkward and shy as
the boys in the milling stag corner at the Firemen's
Ball.</p>

<p>He only asked to be allowed to watch her from
a distance, to wait outside the library hoping
that she would speak to him, or to wander disconsolately
back and forth before her house,
wondering which room was hers, wishing that
some marauder might attempt to break in so that
he could prove his love by cracking the fellow
over the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Love-sick and divinely miserable he walked
the streets at night listening to the wind in the
trees, holding imaginary conversations with his
beloved, devising tests and trials for his devotion.
Sometimes the sweet pain of his affliction seemed
more than he could bear. But when he had a
chance to speak to her there was nothing of this
he could express. He was apt to be rough and
boisterous, or merely shy and dumb.</p>

<p>His emotions could scarcely have been phrased
by Shakespeare nor captured in music by Beethoven,
yet the most that found utterance was:</p>

<p>"Gee, you look swell tonight."</p>

<p>Coming upon her as he rounded the corner at
Main Street and Albion he managed a loud and
joyous greeting. But Maxine had no answering
shout. She took one look at his greasy coveralls,
his blackened hands and face, then turned away.
She did not speak as she passed.</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">At the iron sink in the Crandall kitchen Peter
Brailsford labored to remove the dirt and grease
so offensive to the eyes of Maxine Larabee. He
scoured with violence, grimly pleased by the
stinging of his outraged skin and the smart of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
soap in his eyes. He scowled at himself in the
broken mirror, scrubbed his ears until they burned,
wiped the last trace of his recent shame on Temperance
Crandall's roller towel and was running
a comb through his wet curls when Early Ann
burst radiantly through the kitchen door followed
by the less impulsive Gus.</p>

<p>"Early Ann! Gus!" cried the young fellow.</p>

<p>"Peter! Peter!" cried the girl. "I've inherited
a farm. We'll all go to the movies."</p>

<p>"Not really?" said the astonished Peter as
Early Ann danced him in mad circles about the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"Really," said Early Ann. "And it's been sold,
and I've got the three hundred dollars above the
mortgage."</p>

<p>"Look out," cried the hired man. But his
warning came too late. They had jarred the
lamp from its shelf, and it fell with a crash
scattering glass all over the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>At this inopportune moment Temperance
Crandall returned from shopping. She had been
cheated two cents on eggs, sniggered at by the
pool hall gang, and despite two trips the length
of Main Street had not caught so much as a
glimpse of Timothy Halleck. Now she discovered
her kitchen strewn with glass. Early Ann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
had her hat over one eye, Peter's shirt tail was
out, and Gus was studying the floor.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to," said Gus. "I was just
hunting for some matches for my pipe."</p>

<p>"Didn't mean to," mimicked Temperance.
"Didn't mean to. Well you'd just better get busy
and clean up that mess."</p>

<p>"Yes, mam," said Gus, looking around for
broom and dustpan.</p>

<p>Early Ann giggled. Peter tucked in his shirt
tail. Temperance Crandall whisked off shawl and
bonnet, donned an apron, clattered the griddles
and stoked the fire preparatory to getting supper.</p>

<p>"You're Sarah's hired girl, ain't you?" she
asked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'm Early Ann Sherman."</p>

<p>"When your maw used to work for us...."
Temperance began. Then catching a murderous
look in the kitchen mirror she changed her tune.
"Well now, you and Gus had better stay for
supper," she said. "There's plenty for all."</p>

<p>"No," said Early Ann. "We're eating at the
Ritz Royal this evening. I've inherited a farm."
She pulled her coat about her in an Anna Held
gesture, adjusted her hat, tilted her lovely chin
and started for the door. "Come along, Gus."</p>

<p>"Oh, stay," said Peter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"A farm!" said Temperance.</p>

<p>"Yes, a farm," said Gus, bent double with the
dustpan and feeling surly.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Temperance, "you'd just
better stay for supper. What would Sarah ever
think if I didn't feed you? Take off your coat,
Miss Sherman. And Gus, you can dump that
busted glass out on the ash pile."</p>

<p>Smiling again, Early Ann tossed her hat and
coat over a chair, tied an apron about her waist,
and with the uncanny instinct of one woman in
another woman's kitchen began to set the table
and to help get supper.</p>

<p>Watching the girl, Temperance sighed. She
felt old and tired today. She had never inherited
a farm, and never in her life had she had such
a peaches-and-cream complexion as Early Ann's.
She wished she might have a girl like this one to
help her about the house. She supposed that Miss
Sherman wouldn't be working any more now that
she had come into property, and she put the
question to the newly made heiress.</p>

<p>"You bet I'll go on working," said Early Ann.
"I'm going to save my money. Except enough for
some dresses and maybe a two-week trip to Chicago."</p>

<p>"Are you going to Chicago all by yourself?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
asked the horrified Temperance. But Early Ann
had made up her mind that she had told the town
gossip more than enough.</p>

<p>Gus returned from the ash pile and settled
himself in the kitchen rocker with a copy of the
"Modern Priscilla" replete with corset advertisements,
while Peter loudly announced that if he
were taking Early Ann to the movies he would
have to shave.</p>

<p>"Shave," scoffed Early Ann. "Let's see...."
She ran her fingers over the soft down which covered
his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Pin feathers," she said.</p>

<p>Peter ignored her. He dipped hot water from
the reservoir at the end of the stove, examined
his beard critically in the mirror, and began to
lather in a business-like manner. He wished that
Maxine might see him now.</p>


<p class="p2">Upstairs, Old Mrs. Crandall lay in her bed
wondering what it was that had shaken the house
a few minutes before. After a time she smelled
coffee and knew that there must be company.
Temperance and Peter always drank tea for
supper.</p>

<p>Deaf and bed-ridden, the old woman still kept
in touch with the world with her other senses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Through a rift in the trees she could see the front
of the Methodist Episcopal church and in through
one of the basement windows. She knew what
went on in the elderberry bushes to the south of
the church, and she had seen a flash of Kate Barton's
red dress through the blinds of the belfry
last Thursday and had seen the pigeons and sparrows
come out in dreadful fright. You couldn't
tell Mrs. Crandall that Kate was practicing and
Joe Whalen pumping the organ that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pat O'Toole looked to be about five
months along with her ninth. Peter Brailsford,
from the way he was mooning around, was certainly
in love, probably with Maxine Larabee.</p>

<p>Unlike Temperance, Old Mrs. Crandall had no
desire to reform mankind. She liked to hum popular
music and feel the vibration. She enjoyed
love-making, fights, and all the other delightful
and rowdy actions of mortals. She lay in a world
of almost complete silence, looking out wistfully
at the young people going by, and the blowing
autumn leaves; feeling the wind pushing against
the house. She did not want to die. She wanted
passionately to be alive next spring when the
lilacs bloomed in her front yard.</p>

<p>The odor of frying meat came up to her from
the kitchen, and finally the vibration of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
daughter's feet on the stairs. She hastily brushed
aside two big tears.</p>

<p>"Temperance," she scolded, "you're late with
my victuals."</p>

<p class="p2">Supper that evening was of sufficient social
importance so that Temperance covered the
kitchen oil cloth with her red and white gingham
table cloth, but not of a caliber which demanded
the use of the gloomy dining room adorned with
chromos of dead ducks, fruit, and fish; it was a
function worthy of the Crandall cut-glass teaspoon
tumbler, but scarcely a feast which necessitated
the crocheted and paraffined napkin rings.
Temperance brought out her tureen which she herself
had painted with blue birds and daisies, but
she used the bone-handled knives and forks rather
than the silver plate.</p>

<p>"I hear there's been a man snooping around
out your way," Temperance began after a hasty
blessing, followed by a pan to plate service of
fried potatoes, liver and bacon.</p>

<p>"No one you'd be interested in," said Early
Ann, as saucily as she dared.</p>

<p>"Don't try to be funny," said Temperance.</p>

<p>Temperance had little luck in eliciting any information
about the prowler or about Early Ann's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
farm. The conversation turned to the latest antics
of Ulysses, and of his son Ulysses Jr., who
was proving to be a chip off the old block, to
Sarah's convalescence, the fall plowing, the
hickory nut crop and the plans for a new silo.
Not until the dishes had been cleared away and
Gus had gone his chaste and solitary way did
Early Ann begin to feel confidential.</p>

<p>On the way to the movies she was surprised
to find herself telling Peter all about how she had
inherited the farm at Horicon, about her mother,
and a comic version of the latest Joe Valentine
business. She claimed that she had beaten off Joe
with a stick of stove wood and she had run him
off the place.</p>

<p>"You don't need to worry about me," said
Early Ann. "I can certainly take care of myself.
I'll bet I can even lick you in a wrastle."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you can't," said Peter indignantly.
"Any old day!"</p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Stud Brailsford and Timothy Halleck had been
instrumental in getting Early Ann her small inheritance.
Now Stud wondered whether he had
been wise. Not that Early Ann had been spoiled
by her riches. She was still the same rosy-cheeked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
hardworking, saucy spitfire she had always been.
She was still devoted to Sarah, Peter, Gus and
Stud, and she announced quite passionately that
she intended to live with the Brailsfords and do
their work until the day she died. But now,
added to all the other barriers which kept Stud
from the girl, there was the fact that she was
independently wealthy.</p>

<p>Three hundred dollars was not to be sneezed
at in 1913. True, automobiles and mushroom-brimmed
velvet hats smothered in ostrich plumes
were rather expensive, but the lisle stockings
worn by all the virtuous women of the period
were priced at six pairs for a dollar; high buttoned
shoes usually described as classy, nobby, or
natty sold for two dollars a pair; and no woman
dreamed of squandering more than fifty-nine
cents on a pair of drawers, a corset cover, or a
princess slip.</p>

<p>Free, white, eighteen, full of mustard and
vinegar, and with three hundred dollars in the
bank, the Brailsfords' hired girl was distinctly a
person to be reckoned with. Her new clothes
from Sears Roebuck were the talk of the party
line.</p>

<p>And now, to increase Stud's worries, Early
Ann was insisting on a two weeks' trip to Chicago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
It was unheard of that a girl should make such
an excursion unchaperoned.</p>

<p>It took less than six hours on the C., M. &amp; St.
P. to reach the sinful, brightly lighted metropolis
on Lake Michigan; nevertheless Chicago was
fifty years and a half a world from the muddy village
of Brailsford Junction.</p>

<p>Chicago might rag; make fortunes in wheat,
hogs, and steel; discuss atheism, Freud, and the
early H. L. Mencken. But Brailsford Junction
still attended barn dances and revival meetings.
It lived by the laws of Solomon and Moses
only slightly conditioned by the paganism of
Omar and the invasion of the Ford.</p>

<p>These Junctionites lived by the crude practical
joke, the rough and ready generosity of their
pioneer grandparents, by gossip and by Jesus.
They lived in a world of lamp light and lantern
light, of full corn cribs and Sunday School picnics.
Chicago was almost as remote as Mars.</p>

<p>Even Stud would have made the journey to
Chicago with misgivings; and for an unmarried
young woman to make such a trip was unthinkable.
They all pleaded with her to be sensible.</p>

<p>"I'd never forgive myself," said Sarah. "It's
up to me to keep you safe from harm. I'd worry
myself sick every day you were gone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never heard of a girl going off to Chicago
alone," said Stud. "It ain't right."</p>

<p>"It's a big, wicked city," said Gus, knowingly.
"I went to Chicago once for the Columbian Exposition.
And by golly, the way little Egypt shook
her ..."</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h," said Sarah.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going," said Early Ann, "and that's
that. But, Mrs. Brailsford, you mustn't worry
for a minute. I grew up as wild as a chipmunk
and I guess I can take care of myself."</p>

<p>"But why do you want to go?" Stud asked
the bright-eyed girl, whose ripe young breasts under
her middy rose and fell with her breathing,
and whose well-turned ankles under her sailor
skirt were a treat to the eye.</p>

<p>"I've been wanting all my life to see Chicago,"
Early Ann said. "I never seen a tall building, or
rich ladies riding in limousines, or the silver dollars
in the Palmer House floor. I never seen
Irene Castle dance, or heard Grand Opera, or had
people wait on me like they do in a hotel."</p>

<p>"Yes, Early Ann, I know, I know," said Sarah,
earnestly. "You got a right to have one good time
like that in your life. Everybody has got a right
to be happy just once."</p>

<p>"But I won't budge out of this house if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
ain't well enough yet," said Early Ann. "You've
only been up and around for six days, Mrs.
Brailsford."</p>

<p>"No, no, Early Ann. You mustn't stay on my
account. I'm fit as a fiddle. It's only for your
own good I want you to stay."</p>

<p>"Then I'm going tomorrow on the ten o'clock
train," said Early Ann. She began to pack in the
parlor while the family showered advice and ran
errands.</p>

<p>Sarah kissed her goodby tearfully. Gus was
suspiciously misty-eyed as he carried her telescope
suitcase out to the Ford, and Stud drove
her recklessly to the station where he insisted on
paying for her round-trip ticket and for a chair
on the parlor car&mdash;a luxury he had never allowed
himself.</p>

<p>"You hang on to your money, young lady," he
said. "And don't make up to any city fellows."</p>

<p>He stood watching the train until it had passed
out of sight around the curve, then leaping into
his Ford roared back to the farm where he began
two weeks of mad labor. He worked on the
fences, set posts, strung shining lines of new
barbed wire, pruned several trees and filled a
small ravine with boulders. He trapped a weasel
that had been getting his chickens, put barrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
around his young fruit trees to save them from
the rabbits. He sent for a new stump-puller, seductively
described in the mail order catalogue,
hoping to clean out the brush lot in the slack
months which were ahead.</p>

<p>One morning he noticed that the barns needed
painting. He called in Mack Curren, who had
finally given up hope of being a great portrait
painter. Mack and his crew gave the buildings a
new red coat visible for miles.</p>

<p>"Might as well be fancy and add white trimmings,"
Stud told the willing Mr. Curren.</p>

<p>Stud himself was hard at work on the new silo.
He drove himself happily these days, and he
drove Gus who was not so happy concerning
his employer's sudden desire to move the world,
to paint the farm from end to end, and to add
a wing to the milk house.</p>

<p>Stud remembered to bring in frosty asters and
goldenrod to Sarah. He told her that what she
needed was a wild duck dinner, and he fixed himself
a blind beside the lake and waited, watching
his decoys.</p>

<p>The shotgun shells were heavy and cool in his
hand. The long, clean barrels of his gun shone
like blue fire when he looked through them at the
sun. Not a speck of dust! Every part oiled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
working like a seventeen-jewel watch. The carved
walnut stock was as smooth as satin to his fingers,
and the gun balanced perfectly as he threw
it to his shoulder.</p>

<p>He had carved the decoys himself from white
pine and had painted the intricate markings from
memory. He knew the glossy green head and
bold coloration of the drake mallard, as well as
the more modest hues of his mate. He was familiar
to the last tail feather with the tones and
patterns which distinguish canvasback, redhead,
bluebill, widgeon, goldeneye, and black mallard.
He could imitate the quack of a duck or the honk
of a Canadian goose almost too well for his own
safety.</p>

<p>Bright water bugs skimmed the quietly heaving
surface of the lake. A muskrat with reeds
in his mouth, his nose barely above the water, his
tail trailing for a rudder, swam past the blind.
Stud's live decoys anchored in the shallow water,
preened, tipped for food, gossiped of the days
when they themselves were free to skim southward
ahead of the storms, bound for southern
bayous.</p>

<p>Stud lay back looking up at the immensity of
sky, never more deeply blue, he thought, than
above Wisconsin in the autumn. He watched a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
flight of coots but let them pass; followed a
wood duck with his gun but did not shoot. A hell-diver
was playing among his decoys, and a couple
of green-winged teal went by just out of gunshot,
their wings whirring like toy windmills in a
cyclone.</p>

<p>"Nothing but a ruddy can outfly them," Stud
observed, "and the ruddies fly so darned fast it's
a wonder they don't catch fire."</p>

<p>Toward sunset the flight began in earnest,
and for about ten minutes Stud banged away
like the Federal gunboats before Vicksburg. He
shot his bag limit without crippling a bird, waded
out in hip boots to bring them ashore, and went
singing home, loaded down with rice-fattened
mallards.</p>

<p>One morning he crossed the field of wheat
stubble stretching yellow and frosty on either
hand and went into the brown woods to choose
his trees for winter cutting. It would be good to
swing an axe again, to take big white chips out
of a tree, to hear it crash to the ground and settle
with a sigh. It would be good to get on one end
of a cross-cut saw again, to make Gus cry out for
mercy as they sliced through three feet of oak.
His big muscles yearned for the sixteen pound
mall he used for driving wedges, a sledge which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
made the average man pant like a one-cylinder
gas engine, but which was a plaything for Stud.</p>

<p>At night he came in tired, soaked with sweat,
but almost happy. Sarah noticed and was glad.</p>

<p>Fall, with the red of sumac and of hard maple,
the leathery brown of hickory leaves, and the pale
yellow of elm was upon the land. The leaves
drifted in the brisk winds, and the wind sighed
through the pines of the front yard. The marshes
turned to brown and almost overnight the muskrat
houses sprang up in rough brown piles along
the deeper channels through the grass. The orchard
was a wilderness of ripening, fragrant
fruit, yellow, scarlet and deep red. The house
was banked about with shocks of corn. Five cords
of wood were already sawed and split, and more
would come out of the woods as the days grew
colder.</p>

<p>Gus came running in from the mail box one
morning with a postcard from Early Ann. It had
a picture of a huge hotel where Early Ann was
staying and in a large, girlish hand:</p>

<p>"Having a good time. Wish you were here!"</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pn p1">In the Brailsford Junction Public Library
where the youth of the town came to make love,
look at classic nudes, peruse the stimulating success
stories to be found in the Alger books, explore
the jungles with Livingstone and Stanley, sigh
and weep with the Victorian poets, wallow in
Cooper, Dickens, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Louisa
May Alcott and General Lew Wallace, and if
special favorites of the Librarian to visit the restricted
shelves where such infamous authors as
Lord Byron, Walt Whitman, Anatole France and
Theodore Dreiser languished in sin....</p>

<p>In this den of vicarious iniquity Peter Brailsford
found companions more in harmony with
his spirit than in the town itself, which just now
was banking around its houses with manure, putting
up storm doors, and getting out long underwear,
fur caps, and mackinaws.</p>

<p>Here were Hamlets who wandered brooding
and mourning even as Peter brooded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
mourned. Here were flaming young women who
spoke in well-rounded phrases to dashing, intelligent
young men who really got somewhere in
life. Here were Poetic heroes off on their tremendous
Odysseys through wine-dark seas. Soldiers
of Fortune easily subduing whole South American
Republics.</p>

<p>Reading had been something of a chore while
he was still in high school. Now he read for
the joy of reading, everything he could get his
hands on from Dumas to Ibsen and from Rider
Haggard to Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Haggard's terrific tales curdled his blood and
started him off on the chain of episodes in his own
life which bothered his dreams. The great men
who had stood beside his bed at night bringing
their huge faces closer and closer until he awoke
in a cold sweat; the fear of God which had made
his childhood miserable, the early fear of railroad
trains which during his fourth and fifth years
had sent him terrified into the cellar whenever he
heard the distant whistle and the clanging of the
bell; night fears as when he had gone down into
the woods to find a calf and had heard the
stealthy whisper of some unseen thing passing
through the deep grass; the fear of death and
the absolute finality of damnation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Other authors started other trains of thought
in his mind: nostalgic, wistful, lonely thoughts of
the time when he had been lost and his mother
and father had come hunting him with a lantern.
He had heard them calling far off through the
rain-wet woods. They had wrapped him in a
blanket and they had driven for miles in the
horse and buggy until at last they were at home
again; thoughts of his mother coming to tuck
him in at night and how desperately he wanted
her to come and how fearful he was that she
might forget; thoughts of the picnic to which he
was not invited and how he had lain beneath
the lilac bush watching the other children going
by with their picnic baskets. (Often he was homesick
for the farm.)</p>

<p>But some of the things he read made him fighting
mad, and others made him ambitious. This
evening, waiting for Maxine Larabee, he had
picked up a book on the Gypsies. A young Gypsy
woman stepping from her van had given him
what he thought was a tremendous idea....</p>

<p>Why not a camp trailer fitted up with every
convenience for a traveling home? If Gypsies
could live in vans so could a world of roving
motorists. Here was the idea which would make
him famous and which would cinch his progressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
rise at the "Trailer." He wanted to shout
his discovery to everyone in the room. He wanted
most desperately to find Maxine Larabee and
pour out his hopes and plans.</p>

<p>He could see just how the camp trailer would
look. It would be mounted on a one-ton chassis.
There would be two small windows on each side
and one at the front end fitted out with screens
and bright curtains. There would be a door at
the back with steps which would let down. Inside
there would be one bunk on either side which
would fold up against the wall; a folding table;
built-in, narrow cupboards and clothes press; a
small coal-oil stove for cooking. He felt somewhat
at a loss in designing the tiny kitchen. He
would have to ask Maxine to help him with that.</p>

<p>It suddenly came over him that after he and
Maxine were married they could take their honeymoon
in one of his own camp trailers. He was
sure that she would be an awfully good sport. He
could see her helping to catch their dinner and
cooking it over the camp fire. He took a pencil
and paper from his pocket, began to sketch rapidly.
Despite two years of mechanical drawing
at the high school his fingers lagged behind his
racing mind.</p>

<p>And now the sketch was finished. But where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
was Maxine? He was afraid that she would not
come.</p>

<p>At eight forty-seven, however, there was a stir
near the door. In a new fall ensemble with a
hobble skirt that not one of the girls in the room
had seen before, and which must have been purchased
at some exclusive shop like Bostwick's in
Janesville, the Belle of Brailsford Junction made
her majestic entry. Cleopatra, or Helen of Troy,
or Marie Antoinette could not have slain them
more effectively. And, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, she was
headed for Peter's table. She sat down directly
across from the boy, who, despite his delight,
experienced as always an empty feeling in his
solar plexus, blurred vision, and cold sweat in the
palms of his hands.</p>

<p>"Whatcha reading?" asked Maxine, sticking
her gum on the under surface of the library table
already plastered with dried chicle in geological
strata running back half a decade.</p>

<p>"Uh ... uh ... a book on Gypsies."</p>

<p>"The dirty things," squealed Maxine. "Ee-magine
going out in the woods like that with spiders
and snakes and everything. They steal and
have things in their hair."</p>

<p>"Aw, you're always spoiling everything," said
Peter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, if I'm spoiling everything I'll just run
along," said the girl.</p>

<p>"No, don't. Please stay," said Peter.</p>

<p>"You can walk me home," the girl said, smiling
archly, "if you don't talk about Gypsies and
horrid things like that."</p>

<p>"Can I walk you home?" Peter asked, his disappointment
forgotten, his whole being an ecstasy
of expectation.</p>

<p>"Sure, you can walk me home," Maxine said.
"Walking a girl home don't mean anything. I
let lots of fellows walk me home."</p>

<p>"Gee, Maxine. Gee, you're beautiful tonight."</p>

<p>"Did you notice the hobble skirt?"</p>

<p>"Did I notice it! How could I help but notice
it?"</p>

<p>"I just coaxed and teased till Mamma had to
get it for me."</p>

<p>"Gee, Maxine. You sure look swell in it.
I guess you're the prettiest girl in Rock County."</p>

<p>"In Rock County?" asked Maxine, regarding
him through large, offended eyes from beneath
her coyly-tilted hat brim.</p>

<p>"In the world, I mean," said Peter, feeling his
Adam's apple pressing uncomfortably against his
high, stiff collar.</p>

<p>"Well, it's nine o'clock," said the girl, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Librarian began banging Webster's Dictionary
on her desk,&mdash;the usual signal for closing time.</p>

<p>They walked home together through the fall
evening talking of everything except what was
near their hearts. She took his arm at the crossing,
and the small place where her hand rested
was burning hot beneath his coat. There was a
big harvest moon rising out of the elm trees from
which the leaves were drifting down like large
yellow petals. Their breath was white on the
frosty air. Far overhead they could hear the
honk of the wild geese flying south and the whistle
of wings cutting the air.</p>

<p>They stood for a long time at the gate of the
Larabee home whose windows gleamed invitingly.
A smell of wood-smoke came from the chimney
of the fireplace. The wind stirred in the trees.</p>

<p>"Well, ain't you going to kiss me goodnight,"
Maxine pouted, putting up her lips.</p>

<p>He thought she couldn't have said it. Nothing
so wonderful could happen to a country boy.
He hesitated, looking down at her loveliness, her
lips a trifle apart, her eyes closed, waiting. His
blood was singing a chorus through his temples
and his ears rang with a strange music.</p>

<p>"Well," she said.</p>

<p>But he had waited too long. From the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
door of the Larabee domicile came the booming
voice of Mr. Larabee:</p>

<p>"Maxine! You come right in the house, young
lady. It's after nine o'clock."</p>

<p class="p2">The clock had struck eleven before Peter Brailsford,
tossing on his bed, remembered the camp
trailer which was to revolutionize motoring, the
beautiful little green vans, complete with running
water, small kitchens, electric lights run
from storage batteries, even curtains at the windows.
He went to sleep dreaming of Maxine, of
sweet revenge, and of his trailers.</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">A Hallowe'en party at the Methodist Episcopal
church in Brailsford Junction was a social
event of the first magnitude. The Epworth
Leaguers excelled Salem witch-burners in striking
terror into one another's hearts and upsetting
usually sturdy stomachs. They put skinned grapes
in one another's hands in lieu of cats' eyes, poured
thick red fluid down each other's necks after having
realistically cut the jugular vein with rubber
daggers, they removed boards on the dark stairs to
the organ loft so that one fell ten feet into a pile
of leaves in the woodshed, burned each other with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
red hot pokers which were in reality slivers of
ice, and in general proved themselves worthy disciples
of Torquemada. Unholy shrieks from belfry,
organ loft, and song-book cupboard kept the
girls mildly hysterical. No good young Methodist
would have thought of missing the fun.</p>

<p>For days the entertainment committee had
been decorating and ripping up the church. Half
a cornfield and a wagon load of pumpkins had
been transported to the basement and arranged
realistically around the pillars and in the corners.
Red leaves, jack-o'-lanterns, miles of orange tissue
paper, black cats, witches, and tubs for apple
bobbing completed the effect in the dimly lit cavern
where early on Hallowe'en the young people
began to gather.</p>

<p>Peter arrived at seven-thirty wearing a cardboard
pumpkin head but otherwise uncostumed.
He wanted to parade his stylish new green suit,
his tie which would have enraged a bull, and his
oxfords with exaggerated bows. Young Brailsford
was celebrating his two-dollar-and-a-half
raise at the "Trailer" where he had gained the ear
of Mike O'Casey with his invention and had been
promoted to the role of super office boy in charge
of making blue prints for the draftsmen.</p>

<p>Radiating pride and self-assurance he strode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
across the room toward the knot of Epworth
Leaguers in the far corner. But as he approached
he felt an electric discharge of uncordiality which
could mean but one thing. Bud Spillman, who
was holding forth to his coterie of pretty girls
and local scions, had been jeering at his expense.
Peter was a farm boy and definitely an outsider.</p>

<p>"My, my! Ain't you stylish!" said the erstwhile
football hero, dressed for the occasion in
Roman toga and laurel wreath.</p>

<p>"Take that back or I'll give you a poke,"
warned Peter, forgetting that he stood on sacred
ground.</p>

<p>"All right, hayseed. You look like you was all
dressed up for greasing trailers."</p>

<p>"Come on out in back and I'll show you."</p>

<p>"You might get your new pants all dirty,"
said Bud.</p>

<p>The crowd sniggered.</p>

<p>"What about your nightshirt?"</p>

<p>"Don't get funny or I'll make you laugh out
of the other side of your mouth."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a leave," Peter said.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't dirty my hands fighting a clodhopper.
Go clean your cowbarns."</p>

<p>"What about you?" Peter said. "Your old
man runs a livery stable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kick in his box car," the boys shouted to
Bud, "poke him in the breadbasket."</p>

<p>"Anybody busted in your new shoes?" Bud
asked, stamping on one of Peter's toes and spitting
on the crushed leather.</p>

<p>Unwanted tears were welling up in Peter's eyes
but his voice was brave and scornful. "I dare
you. I double-dare you. You yellow Brailsford
Junction smart Aleck!"</p>

<p>Then a minor miracle occurred. Maxine Larabee
squealed, "Punch him in the nose, Peter.
Knock his block off."</p>

<p>That was all the encouragement Peter needed.
Dumbfounded but deliriously happy and filled
with a soul-satisfying desire to beat Bud Spillman
to a pulp he waded into the big fellow while
the girls scattered screeching to view the fight
from piano-top or chair, and the boys formed a
yelling circle about the young battlers.</p>

<p>"Knock him for a gool ... cave in his
shanty ... kick him in the belly," advised Bud
Spillman's supporters. They also suggested that
he beat Peter's ears off, flatten his beezer and
knock all his teeth down his throat. Forgetting
the fact that they were in the presence of ladies
and the Methodist Deity, these same young
Christians remembered and used effectively all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the forbidden four-letter Anglo-Saxon words.</p>

<p>More agile than his big opponent, lighter on
his feet and faster with his punches, Peter slipped
in and out with sharp slashing blows which
bruised and cut the big football player but did
not stop him. Bud's haymakers seldom connected,
but when they did they carried the weight of a
pile driver behind them.</p>

<p>They clinched, broke apart, flayed the air,
drew a little blood, maneuvered about the basement
knocking over shocks of corn and stumbling
on pumpkins. Bud began to tire while Peter was
still as fresh as a daisy. This change in probabilities
did not go unnoticed by the ringside who one
by one shifted their loyalties to the farm boy.
Maxine in particular was cheering for Peter.
Now they were all engrossed in telling their new
hero just how to mutilate the winded Spillman.</p>

<p>Peter was slipping through the guard of the
big fellow time after time. He gave him a final
clip to the chin followed by a clout which sent
Bud spinning and by accident landed him squarely
in a tub filled with water for apple bobbing....</p>

<p>"Boys, boys! In the House of God?" cried
the Reverend Mr. Tooton, who had entered at
that moment. "Is that Christian? Is that the way
Jesus teaches us to treat one another?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"He started it," blubbered Bud Spillman who
was struggling to get out of the icy water.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I finished it," said Peter. He walked
over to where the Bully stood crestfallen and
dripping, and added in an undertone, "Any more
funny stuff at the 'Trailer' and I'll give you a
real licking."</p>

<p>"I'm your friend," said Bud. "I always was
your friend."</p>

<p>With the ice very thoroughly broken, and
everyone at his hilarious ease, the fun began.
Peter, a somewhat disheveled but happy ringleader,
promoted charades, Blind Man's Bluff,
Drop the Handkerchief, Skip-Come-a-Lou, and
a version of the Virginia Reel which included elements
of the Tango and the Bunny Hug. They
splashed and shrieked while bobbing for apples,
giggled as they stole kisses in the Den of Horrors
and behind the piano, sang at the top of their
lungs while playing Four in a Boat and Going
to Jerusalem, and ended a perfectly wonderful
evening with pumpkin pie and coffee.</p>

<p>Bud Spillman left early.</p>

<p>And that night, for the second time in their
lives, Peter and Maxine walked together under
the bright autumn stars. They watched, with the
superior amusement of teen-age individuals the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Hallowe'en antics of the younger hellions who
were taking out a year's grievances on Old Man
Ottoson who always spoiled the ice on his hill by
spreading ashes, Aunt Nellie Fitch who was
stingy with her apples, and Grandpa Green who
had once peppered with rock salt a boy who was
stealing one of his watermelons. It was only tit
for tat if the kids now ripped up their board
sidewalks, pulled down their gates, and tipped
over their backhouses.</p>

<p>Peter lent a hand hoisting a particularly obstreperous
billy goat onto the porch roof of Old
Lady Perkins' general store, then, with his girl
on his arm, strolled leisurely to the Tobacco City
Ice Cream Parlor, where beneath pink and green
lights reflected in gilt-framed mirrors they lingered
long over a concoction known as "Lover's
Delight" while the nickel-in-the-slot piano played
"Everybody's Doing It."</p>

<p>Feeling deliciously extravagant, he bought her
a three pound box of bon bons adorned with
large red roses, and they made their way through
the crisp cold to Maxine's home on the hill where
the girl discovered with joy that her parents
were not yet home from their evening of bridge
in Janesville, wherefore Peter must come in for a
cup of hot cocoa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Unbelievable delight! To be invited into her
house. To be near her, allowed to touch her, and
perhaps even to kiss her if he chose.</p>

<p>The very air seemed different in the house
where his love ate and slept and bathed and
dressed. He was sure that never before had he
seen anything so exquisite as the sofa pillows
she had made out of cigarette flags, or the pictures
she had burned on wood.</p>

<p>She had a little alcove off the sitting room
which was all her own hung with school pennants
and drawings of the Charles Dana Gibson variety.
She had a cupboard full of bon bon boxes, dance
programs, comic postcards inscribed with "Oh,
You Girl!" and a whole album of snapshots.</p>

<p>Peter was awed. He had never before seen
an alcohol burner nor a chafing dish. He watched
the glowing girl as she prepared cocoa and Welsh
rarebit, was delighted with every movement she
made and every word she spoke.</p>

<p>"I got a raise," Peter said. "I'm a draftsman's
assistant now. Mike O'Casey says he might build
one of my camp trailers when I get it designed."</p>

<p>"Gee, could I meet Mr. O'Casey sometime?"
Maxine asked.</p>

<p>"Well, gosh, Maxine. I dunno. That's pretty
hard to arrange."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, all right, smarty. You think he's too
good for a little girl like me."</p>

<p>"But, darling...." He could have bitten his
tongue for having said a thing like that. Calling
her "darling"! Who did he think he was? She
stood perfectly still, waiting.</p>

<p>"You're an awful pretty girl," he said at last.
He watched her as she turned to the chafing dish
again. Her movements were deft and very feminine.</p>

<p>"I ... I wish you would let me kiss you like
you said that night."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Maxine. She turned up her
face for the first kiss Peter had given a girl in
his life.</p>

<p>To Peter the world was non-existent for that
moment. Maxine broke away to keep the cocoa
from boiling over.</p>

<p>Afterwards she turned out the lights and they
sat on the sofa looking out into the starlight.
They could see across the creek and across mysterious
miles of frozen brown marshland beyond
the town to where lights twinkled in distant
farmhouses. She put his hand down the neck of
her dress and he was surprised and almost frightened
by the soft delicacy of her breasts.</p>

<p>"Well," said Maxine from the depths of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
pillows. "Are you just going to sit there all
night?"</p>

<p>She put her arms around him and kissed him
again and again. She drew him down toward
her and he found himself strangely wishing to
be free.</p>

<p>"No, no, Maxine," he said humbly. "I
couldn't. Why, Maxine, you're just an angel
to me. I never even thought of you like that."</p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Throughout the rest of her days Temperance
Crandall measured time as before or after 1913.
Often in later Novembers when the leaves hurried
across her lawn and the hickory nuts tumbled
down from the shagbark hickory she dabbed at
her eyes with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>It was of little interest to her that Mrs. Sean
McGinty died of cancer of the uterus after bearing
thirteen children in eighteen years, or that
Father O'Malley in laying her away spoke of
her as an outstanding example of motherhood.
She scarcely bothered to learn the details of the
scandalous conduct of the Reverend Charles MacArthur
of the Congregational church who had
been caught in a compromising situation with his
soprano soloist, thus confirming the worst suspicions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of the Methodists. And although Gerty
MacDougal, 18, entered the bonds of holy matrimony
with Cornelius Vandenheim, 82, just in
time to inherit a Civil War pension for life, Temperance
all but forgot to pass on the information
to Sister Dickenson.</p>

<p>For Temperance Crandall was discovering that
when tragedy and scandal touch one's own household
the salt has lost its savor.</p>

<p>In the first place her mother was definitely
sinking. Doctor Whitehead doubted that the old
heart could stand the strain of another winter.
Secondly Temperance's own Peter Brailsford was
being seen so often with that wanton hussy Maxine
Larabee that Temperance could have wept.
Now, as she waited for Peter to come to breakfast,
the harsh whisper of calloused fingers on
hard knuckles filled the room.</p>

<p>Peter Brailsford, awaking from a sound sleep,
was instantly aware that this was no usual day.
He jumped out of bed with a shout, threw his
flannel nightgown into a corner, dashed half a
pitcher of icy water into the wash bowl, and with
chattering teeth sponged his warm skin with a
washcloth and rubbed dry with a rough towel.
He danced around on his toes throwing a flurry
of effective punches into some large, tough adversary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
burst into a baritone solo which suddenly
went soprano, pulled on long scratchy underwear,
corduroy trousers, stiff cowhide boots, and a rough
woolen shirt and hurried to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Um! Pancakes!"</p>

<p>"Put on plenty of butter and mmaple syrup,"
said Temperance. "I ain't going to let any boy
starve under my roof."</p>

<p>It was a bright, cold Saturday morning. Peter
had begged the day off. Now he ran shouting
with exuberance to join the crowd gathered on
the Library steps. Maxine, the English teacher
for chaperon, and nearly a dozen others were
headed for Lake Koshkonong and a day in the
woods.</p>

<p>They piled into an ancient Ford three deep
and several on the running boards, chugged and
steamed up hills and through valleys bright with
maple and sumac until at last they came to
Charley's Bluff where they unloaded and built a
fire of driftwood on the beach between huge
granite boulders. They raced, wrestled and shot
at targets with a twenty-two, buried each other
in the leaves and shook down hickory nuts.</p>

<p>At noon they gathered about the fire to roast
wieners on sticks and to drink black coffee.</p>

<p>All went well until the couples paired off and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Maxine decided to sing songs to the accompaniment
of Thomas Carlyle's five-string banjo. Who
did that half-witted son of a horse-doctor think
he was, Peter wondered. They were making outrageous
love, Peter thought. Starting off with
such comparatively innocuous ditties as "Moonlight
Bay" and "You're a Great Big Blue-Eyed
Baby," they were soon harmonizing on "Cuddle
Up a Little Closer, Lovey Mine," and "Every
Little Movement Has a Meaning All Its Own."
Peter began to wonder what sort of a girl Maxine
was.</p>

<p>Then he was remorseful.</p>

<p>He was ashamed that he had let himself
question Maxine's character. Certainly she had
never let another boy kiss her or touch her breasts.
She was sitting beside Thomas Carlyle singing
songs because he had a banjo; but very soon now
she would come over to Peter and they would
wander off together. He mustn't let himself be
jealous like this. Peter didn't think that he
could trust himself if he should find that Maxine
was in any way unfaithful. He thought that
he would kill her and then himself, and that
people would find them locked in each other's
arms.</p>

<p>He would write a verse for their common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
gravestone which would be inscribed beneath twin
turtle doves on pure white marble.</p>

<p>He told himself that he was talking nonsense,
that no boy should keep his girl from singing
songs and flirting a little. But he lay among the
leaves, looking up at the sky and brooding over
the loss of this precious day which was to mean
so much to them. He had intended to ask her
to marry him and had thought out just what he
was going to say. He had intended to tell her
that first love like theirs was always true love,
and how their marriage wouldn't turn out like
so many marriages. Their life together was going
to be different.</p>

<p>He had envisioned the whole scene over and
over. They would be cozily sitting in deep leaves
in some protected ravine with nothing but the
trees and sky to hear what they were saying. He
would pour out his heart, and she would listen
with rapt attention and turn up her lips for
kisses.</p>

<p>He would tell her of his progress at the factory,
and of the house they would have on Shannon's
hill. They would talk about their children, and
about life together after they were married. It
was to have been an idyllic day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>And now, a gaunt, freckle-faced, banjo-strumming
young fool had spoiled it all. Peter felt
like going over and pushing the boy in the face
and picking up Maxine as he might a child and
carrying her away. It would be easy to do. She
was as light as a feather and always tripped
along as though she were made of thistle down.
Her flesh was like thistle down too. It made
his head whirr to think of her soft flesh.</p>

<p>Always, always something came between Peter
and happiness. He had been brooding and miserable
for as long as he could remember, with only
now and then a moment of intense happiness to
repay him for his misery.</p>

<p>All his life he had worried about good and
evil, about God and hell, about his features,
his clothes, what people were thinking of him, and
whether he would ever amount to anything. And
now that he was in love he was experiencing a
deeper and more exquisite misery than he could
have imagined possible.</p>

<p>Maxine! Maxine!</p>

<p>But here she came at last, all radiant and smiling,
her cheeks as red as apples. His heart leapt
up in a moment and all his doubts left him. They
walked along the beach, skipped stones on the
thin ice and on the open stretches of water, dug a
bird's nest out of the high, black banks of peat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
which skirt the beach to the south of Charley's
Bluff. They discovered a little stream and followed
its course back through the willows to a
clearing where they explored a deserted cabin
and a barn still filled with timothy and clover.
From the wide door of the loft they could see
across the lake to Lake House Point and to the
Brailsford farm with its bright red barns and to
the great cottonwood tree on Cottonwood Hill.</p>

<p>"You see that big tree," Peter said. "Not a
man in the country can climb it, not even my
father. But I'm going to climb it some day."</p>

<p>"Uh huh," said Maxine comfortably.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do lots of things in my life.
Great things. I'm learning a heap about draftsmanship
at the Trailer factory. I'm almost finished
with my blue prints for that camp trailer.
Maybe some day when I get to be famous...."</p>

<p>"Don't talk shop," Maxine said.</p>

<p>"Well, what shall we talk about?"</p>

<p>"Don't let's talk, beautiful boy."</p>

<p>She stopped his mouth with kisses and unashamed
gave him his first lesson in love.</p>

<p class="p2">As was usual in Brailsford Junction death came
before the doctor. Temperance was alone in the
house when her mother died. She went up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
stairs at six o'clock bringing the old lady a bite
of supper and found her breathing heavily and
rather chilled. She tried to reach Doctor Whitehead
by telephone, but no one answered at the
house or the office. She called out the upstairs
window to a passing boy and told him to look for
the doctor in front of the pool hall, then turned
back to the stricken woman who opened her eyes
once and smiled at Temperance feebly.</p>

<p>Temperance thought that the poor old thing
was humming a hymn but when she leaned closer
she realized that it was "Daisy Bell," a great
favorite of her mother's. Thinking about it later
she realized that her mother had never been what
Brailsford Junction usually termed a Christian.</p>

<p>Even before the death rattle began, the thin
face turned blue and the small hands clutching
the counterpane were as cold as ice.</p>

<p>Temperance did not break down until she had
pulled the sheet up over the face of the dead.
Then a great flood of loneliness and grief came
over her and she ran down the street in her house
dress with her hair stringing out behind. Hardly
knowing what she was doing she hurried up the
stairs leading to the offices of Timothy Halleck
and incidentally to the fly-blown waiting-room
of Doctor Whitehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Brailsford Junction's leading physician was
hanging up his prevaricating gilt placard, "Back
in Half an Hour."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I was just heading for your
home," he said. "I hope it ain't anything serious.
How is your mother?"</p>

<p>"As well as could be expected with you on the
case," cried Temperance, bitterly. "She died fifteen
minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Now ain't that too bad," said Doctor Whitehead,
squirting a stream of tobacco juice into a
convenient corner. "I suppose you'll want a death
certificate, eh?"</p>

<p>Temperance burst in upon Timothy Halleck
who during that day had met a delegation of indignant
mothers complaining about the oldest son
of Crazy Jack Bailey, a young wife whose
drunken husband beat her up every Saturday
night with the stove poker, and the president of
the bank who threatened to cut off his credit if
he cancelled his mortgage against the Widow
Morrison. For once his patience was tried beyond
endurance.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Crandall, this time I will not listen
to your gossip. I've heard all that I can
stand for one day. Why can't you leave people
alone? Let them live their lives and you live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
yours. For twenty years I've been wanting to
tell you that you're a meddlesome, tale-bearing....
There, there now. Don't cry, Temperance.
I realize I was a bit thoughtless. Why ... why,
what is it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know who else to tell," Temperance
said, hiding her face in her hands. "Mother's
dead, Timothy."</p>

<p>Temperance Crandall was to remember to her
dying day that Timothy Halleck came around the
desk and put his arm across her shoulders and
told her that he would take care of the funeral
arrangements.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pn p1">The eastbound train had gone shrieking
through Brailsford Junction pulled by two engines
to buck the drifts. Bundles of Madison
papers were tossed from the baggage car as the
train passed, and the engineer had waved at
Nat Cumlien, the station master.</p>

<p>Now in a corner of the station half a dozen
rosy-faced young rascals fought and laughed as
they stuffed their paper sacks.</p>

<p>"Wish I had about ten kids," thought Stud,
watching the boys while waiting for the long
over-due four-thirty-nine from Chicago. "Six or
eight sons and a batch of girls."</p>

<p>He sighed as he looked out at the unexpected
November blizzard. The telephone wires sang
a high monotonous tune. Snow drifted in rippled
waves over the tracks and the cinder piles beyond.
The station windows rattled in the forty
mile gale and the telegraph instrument kept up
its incessant, monotonous tattoo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gol darn! There never was nothing in my
life I wanted like a lot of youngsters. Big strapping
boys to help me with the cows and crops.
Good looking girls to help Sarah."</p>

<p>He spat reflectively at the roaring stove, shifted
his position on the bench.</p>

<p>"Peter's a good boy, and he certainly ran that
thrashing machine slicker than a greased pig.
But now he's figuring on spending all his mortal
days in a trailer factory."</p>

<p>He couldn't make the boy out, always mooning
around and sighing. Not mean nor hard to
handle, but with a head full of silly ideas. Maybe
all he needed was to sow his wild oats.</p>

<p>Peter'd make a good enough farmer if he'd
put his mind to it. He was smart enough, and
strong enough, and a real good worker. But
Stud doubted that he would ever see the boy back
on the farm again.</p>

<p>He wished he had a dozen big sons, strapping
fellows who could handle a quarter section at
sixteen. He wished it were as easy to get human
young ones as it was calves, colts and
lambs.</p>

<p>Why, if a mare didn't foal you tried another
mare. If a cow didn't calve you turned her into
beef steak. And any stallion, bull or ram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
could serve half a hundred females of his species.</p>

<p>"Wish I had a harem," thought Stud; "I'd
get me all the children a man could want. We've
got enough victuals to feed about forty on that
farm. I'd breed 'em big and feed 'em plenty.
It'd be a sight for sore eyes to see my litter."</p>

<p>Stud was awaiting Early Ann's train from the
big city. She would be getting off the cars any
time now all rosy and fresh and pert with her
tongue running away with her and her feet fairly
dancing. Young, healthy, and going to waste.
What was the matter with young fellows these
days, didn't they know a good thing when they
saw it? Early Ann was just what Stud needed
around the farm: a good little filly that'd make
a good mare.</p>

<p>"Shoot, such a way to talk," thought Stud,
spitting at the glowing stove. "Can't breed humans
like you breed cattle. Got to think about
marriage vows and morality and all that sort
of business."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the thought stayed with him,&mdash;how
he was getting along in his forties and how
he wanted more boys. Often that winter he
would stop work in the snowy fields where he was
husking corn to look out across the frozen lake
and sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Four-thirty-nine'll be another half hour late,"
said Nat Cumlien, coming out of his cage to throw
half a hod of soft coal into the stove. "Got some
big drifts down near Janesville."</p>

<p>"Four-thirty-nine ain't been on time in ten
years, drifts or no drifts," said Stud.</p>

<p>"Well, I do my best," said Nat.</p>

<p>He went out onto the platform and changed
the lantern, threw a couple of bundles of hides
and some milk cans onto the truck, came in blowing
on his fingers and brushing off the snow.</p>

<p>"Whew, that'd freeze the ears off a brass monkey,"
said Nat. He retired to his cage and his
game of solitaire.</p>

<p>After an eternity the big headlight cut through
the snow and the muffled whistle shook the windows.
Stud hurried out to the platform as the
train wheezed in and ground to a stop. Early
Ann jumped off, laughing and squealing. He
carried her baggage to the cutter and they streaked
home through the storm to the accompaniment of
jingling sleigh-bells and creaking snow beneath
the polished runners. Deeply covered with robes
and sharing each other's warmth, they shouted
to each other above the storm.</p>

<p>It was good to be home again, good to be turning
in at the Brailsford gate with the windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of the farmhouse shining on the snow. Stud hurried
off to unhitch while Gus helped Early Ann
with her bundles.</p>

<p>Sarah stood on the back stoop shivering and
wiping her hands on her apron.</p>

<p>"Welcome home, Early Ann," she cried.</p>

<p>"Here I am safe and sound, Mrs. Brailsford.
I had a wonderful time."</p>

<p>"Did you see the stock yards?" Gus wanted
to know. "Or Sears, Roebuck's?"</p>

<p>"It'll take a year to tell all I saw," said Early
Ann. She went into the warm, lamp-lit kitchen
fragrant with the smells of pie and coffee and
roasting meat. They had a surprise for Early
Ann. Gus had caught a raccoon in one of his
traps. They were having a raccoon supper with
sweet potatoes and corn bread.</p>

<p>"Hope it tastes as good as it smells," said
Early Ann. "Here, Mrs. Brailsford, let me help
with everything."</p>

<p>"Change your dress first, child."</p>

<p>Throughout supper she regaled them with the
wonders of Chicago: the room she had had six
stories above the street with electric lights and a
brass bed, and a private bathroom with hot and
cold running water. She had lived like a queen.
She had slept until eight o'clock every morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and once she had taken her breakfast in
bed.</p>

<p>"And you should see the limousines and street
cars, and boats on the river! They got bridges
that lift up, and buildings five times as tall as
the windmill," said Early Ann.</p>

<p>"Did you see the Board of Trade?" Stud
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"No I didn't," the girl admitted, "but I saw
a woman smoking a cigarette, and couples doing
the tango on a glass dance floor. It was lovely
the way they served food, with white napkins and
pretty glass and silver."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you went," Sarah said. "It'll be
something to think about until the day you die."</p>

<p>"Such pretty dresses in the stores," said Early
Ann. "I sure do wish you could have been along,
Mrs. Brailsford. I bought myself a new corset
and.... Oh, I shouldn't."</p>

<p>"Don't mind me," said Gus.</p>

<p>"There was a big parade for Emmeline Pankhurst
who came all the way from London to talk
about woman suffrage, and I was as close as across
this room from her. She looked like a fighter all
right."</p>

<p>"She's a criminal," said Gus, "she oughta be
hanged."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's a great leader and a fine woman," said
Sarah, quietly. "They'll treat her like a real saint
before she dies."</p>

<p>"And everybody was all aflutter about General
Booth coming to town, and I went to a drama
called 'Lead, Kindly Light.' It was awful uplifting."</p>

<p>When she couldn't think of another thing to
tell them, Early Ann brought some packages to
the table.</p>

<p>"This is for you, Mrs. Brailsford."</p>

<p>Sarah opened the pretty box with trembling
fingers, saying, "You shouldn't have done it,
Early Ann. I don't deserve a thing." And when
she found silk stockings in the box she started
to cry.</p>

<p>"Why, I never had a pair of silk stockings in
my life," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll have to watch you, now you got silk stockings,"
said Stud. "You'll be running off with
Vern Barton or somebody the first thing I know."</p>

<p>Sarah looked through the silk at the lamp and
rubbed the smooth stuff against her cheek. She
kept them treasured in her bureau drawer, but
never wore them to the day she died.</p>

<p>The present Early Ann had bought for Gus
was a set of arm garters and matching green tie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
The hired man grinned like a Cheshire cat when he
opened the box.</p>

<p>Stud was given a magnificent, fancy white vest
of imported bird's-eye weave with detachable
pearl buttons.</p>

<p>"Never seen anything so classy in all my born
days," said Stud, slipping into the vest. He put
his watch in the watch pocket, draped his gold
log-chain across his middle, and paraded in front
of the kitchen mirror, holding up the lamp to get
the full effect.</p>

<p>"That's mighty nice of you, girl," said Stud.
"I reckon I ought to kiss you for that."</p>

<p>"Stanley," said Sarah, in laughing disapproval,
"I reckon you better not."</p>

<p>Early Ann said she would keep Peter's present
until she saw him. Meanwhile she had one more
gift for the entire family. She unwrapped a small
stereopticon on which she had squandered seven
dollars. Sarah put up a sheet at one end of the
kitchen, while Early Ann lighted the coal-oil
lamp in the little black box and blew out all the
other lights in the room. There in the warm, dark
kitchen they spent two magic hours. Over and
over again they called for "Rock of Ages,"
"Niagara Falls," "The Statue of Liberty," "The
Sinking of the Maine" and "The Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Monument." Altogether there were twenty-four
slides in full color.</p>

<p>"Next time you go to Chicago you got to take
me," said Gus, pouring Early Ann another mug
of cider.</p>

<p class="p2">It was not until Early Ann saw Peter, and gave
him the gold watch she had bought him, that she
told the other side of her trip to Chicago.</p>

<p>"I was scared half the time and so lonesome.
I felt like coming home on the first train. I didn't
know a single soul and the city was so big and
noisy. You don't catch me going to Chicago all
alone again."</p>

<p>"And I'll bet you spent all your money," Peter
growled accusingly.</p>

<p>"I got two hundred and three dollars left,"
said Early Ann, averting her eyes. "I feel kind
of wicked when I think how I've squandered
ninety-seven dollars. But I ain't going to spend
one more cent until the day I'm married. I've
got to have something left to help set up housekeeping."</p>

<p>"Who you going to marry?" Peter asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I got a fellow," lied Early Ann. She
wanted to egg him on, and she was a trifle disappointed
at the casual way in which he had taken it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">One windy November afternoon when Stud
and Gus were cutting firewood in the grove beside
the lake, Stud looked across the bay and was
surprised to see smoke streaming from the chimney
of the old hunting lodge on Lake House
Point. The blizzard, which had flung ten-foot
waves against the crumbling cliff, had stripped
the leaves from oak and elm and maple, sent them
in cascades down every ravine and gully, left the
old building naked to the eye.</p>

<p>"Looks like we got a neighbor," said Stud.</p>

<p>"Better not monkey with my mushrat traps."</p>

<p>"What'd you do?"</p>

<p>"Pepper his behind with rock salt from the old
ten gauge."</p>

<p>"You talk big," Stud admitted. "Why don't
you mosey over and see who it is?"</p>

<p>"Not me," said Gus. "It ain't healthy."</p>

<p>Stud grinned. He knew that Gus would rather
sleep in a cemetery or break a looking-glass than
set foot on Lake House Point.</p>

<p>Long ago the limestone bluff had been the
stronghold of Indians. Later a small colony of
Mormons, hated alike for their polygamy and
their horse-thieving, had made the Point their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hide-away until chased from the country by the
indignant settlers. In the eighties a club of rich
Chicago duck hunters had put up the present
lodge where shortly before the turn of the century
a bloody murder had occurred. No one went near
the lodge now. The porches were drifted deep
with leaves, the old boathouse was strewn in
whitened planks the length of the beach. The
bluff was overgrown with sumac, ivy and grapevines.
Scrub oak extended from the edge of the
cliff to the marsh behind the Point.</p>

<p>Old women, children and hired hands believed
implicitly that ghosts could be seen at the broken
windows of the lodge and in the rotting halls and
paneled rooms. Stud scoffed at all these old-wives'
tales, but admitted he would rather live
on his own side of the bay than on that bluff
with its unpleasant memories.</p>

<p>"Might be that feller," suggested Gus.</p>

<p>"The one prowling around here nights?"</p>

<p>"Might be."</p>

<p>"Might be, but probably ain't."</p>

<p>Possibly Gus was right. Stud had an uneasy
feeling that a man by the name of Joe Valentine
was living in the lodge, trapping perhaps, catching
fish, stealing a few chickens.</p>

<p>Stud had heard of Joe Valentine from Timothy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Halleck who in tracing Early Ann's claim to the
Horicon farm had run across Joe's trail. Later
Early Ann herself had admitted the existence of
this stepfather, and had confessed to Stud that
it was Joe who had been annoying her. She told
Stud something of her early life, her days with
Joe and her mother in the shack near Rockford,
Illinois, her mother's death, and her flight from
her stepfather.</p>

<p>She said she had been ashamed of Joe, of his
treatment of her mother, and of his attitude
toward <i>her</i>. She had wanted to forget the past,
to live where no one would know that she was
the illegitimate child of Bung Sherman, or the
stepdaughter of Joe Valentine.</p>

<p>Stud thought of Joe as more of a nuisance than
a menace. Nevertheless he was determined to
investigate his new neighbor on Lake House
Point.</p>

<p>Other matters intervened. Ulysses S. Grant
had acquired a taste for chicken, and almost every
unlucky fowl who got into his pen was caught by
the wily boar and eaten alive. Stud had to put
chicken wire outside the planks of the boar's pen
to save Sarah's flock from destruction.</p>

<p>Then there was the problem of Peter and Maxine
Larabee. Stud was of the opinion that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
boy would never be a man until he learned the
facts of life first-hand, but Sarah was worrying
herself into another nervous breakdown. Stud
made a futile trip to town. Peter was belligerent
and uncommunicative. Stud was outwardly
bellicose but secretly sympathetic. The net result
was a widened breach between father and son, although
Stanley led Sarah to believe that he had
put some sense into the boy's head.</p>

<p>Brailsford had momentarily forgotten his plan
to investigate the old hunting lodge when one
morning&mdash;the day before Thanksgiving&mdash;he
found a man setting a trap at the end of a hollow
log just out of sight of the house over the crest
of Cottonwood Hill.</p>

<p>"Trying to catch one of my 'coons?" Stud
asked amiably.</p>

<p>The man whirled to face him, his hand on his
sheath knife.</p>

<p>"Nothing to fight about," said Stud. "What's
your name?"</p>

<p>"Joe Valentine."</p>

<p>"You ain't the fellow who's moved in over
on the Point?"</p>

<p>"That's my business," said Joe.</p>

<p>"I'll make it my business. You been prowling
around here quite a bit lately."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"I got a right to catch my living," said Joe.
Every night he looked across the bay at the glowing
windows of the Brailsford farm, thought of
his stepdaughter over there, all the good things
to eat. "I got a right," he said.</p>

<p>"I got a right to run you off my land."</p>

<p>"You ain't got a right to Early Ann."</p>

<p>"Get off my place before I get mad," Stud
said. He had his womenfolks and cattle to think
about.</p>

<p>Joe whipped out his knife and prepared to
spring. Like sticking a pig, he thought. Like the
time his father killed his kitten with a butcher
knife. He had buried the cat and put flowers on
its grave. After a few days he dug it up to see if
it had gone to heaven.</p>

<p>Joe leapt. Stud sidestepped, put out his foot.
Joe tripped, fell into the bushes, turned a complete
somersault and was up again, knife in
hand.</p>

<p>"You're going to hurt yourself with that knife,"
Stud said. "We don't fight with knives in these
parts."</p>

<p>Stud never gouged or bunted, but he could
see that anything went with Joe Valentine.</p>

<p>Joe sprang again. His knife slashed empty
air. Simultaneously something like a sledge hammer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
hit him behind the ear. He staggered,
whirled.</p>

<p>More careful now, the men feinted, maneuvered,
circled for advantage.</p>

<p>Joe doubled over as though caught with pain.
Stud rushed. Joe tossed a handful of snow and
fine gravel into Stud's eyes. Half-blinded, Stud
leapt back. He felt the knife rip into his right
shoulder and the blood wet his shirt. Bright
blood sprinkled the dirty snow.</p>

<p>Now Stud was fighting in earnest. As Joe
came on, Stud aimed a kick at the knife arm,
missed, fell. Joe tried to hamstring the fallen
giant, was lifted bodily into the air by a great
backward kick.</p>

<p>They were up again, feinting and charging.
Stud grabbed the knife arm in a clinch, held it as
in a vise, slugged with his other fist Joe's head
and body. Joe brought up his knee. Sickness
swept over Stud in a great wave.</p>

<p>They were rolling on the ground now, panting
and straining, tearing up the bloody snow and
gravel. Stud caught Joe's arm in a hammer-lock.
Joe screamed in pain, dropped his knife. Stud
grabbed for a full Nelson, and Joe slipped out
of his grasp like a snake.</p>

<p>Stud kicked the knife out of reach as they leapt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to their feet. They slugged, sweat and panted.
Two men on a hilltop overlooking the world.
Murder in their hearts.</p>

<p>Joe was quicker and more slippery, a tricky
boxer, fast with rabbit punches, kidney punches,
jabs below the belt. Stud had the power of a bull,
was tireless and able to take almost limitless
punishment. He sent haymakers crashing to Joe's
lantern jaw, heart, and solar plexus. His shoulder
was throbbing, but he battled on.</p>

<p>Joe made a crying sound through his torn lips.
Suddenly he was afraid. He turned and ran down
the hill through the hazel brush, sobbing, breathless.</p>

<p>Stud did not follow. He watched Joe Valentine
bee-lining for Lake House Point. Slowly
he doubled his right arm and felt the huge bicep.</p>

<p>"That's the last we'll see of Joe Valentine,"
he told the giant cottonwood. He chuckled as
he strode back toward the house.</p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">With silos full, full haymows, bins of grain;
with sheds loaded to the last beam with tobacco;
with the farm shipshape and bright with new
paint they faced the coming winter.</p>

<p>The provision cellar was loaded with earthenware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
crocks of pickles, sauerkraut and preserves;
glasses of jelly; mason jars of cherries, applesauce,
plums, pears, raspberries, and strawberries.</p>

<p>The smokehouse reeked of ham and pleasant
hickory smoke from morning until night. Hams
hung in the cellar beside the slabs of bacon, and
the small white ears of popcorn. In a dry bin
with a wooden floor were hickory nuts and walnuts
by the bushel with a few pecks of butternuts and
hazel nuts to furnish variety.</p>

<p>Apple cider in brown jugs, wild grape juice in
tight bottles, with just a gallon or two of blackberry
cordial in case of sickness lined the lower
shelf of the can cupboard. There were bins of
sand for carrots, beets and celery. Pie pumpkins
in one corner, hubbard squashes in another.</p>

<p>And although Stanley Brailsford longed for
more children, wished that Sarah could have
better health, and mourned the rift which was
slowly arising between himself and Peter, he had
much to be thankful for as he said the blessing
over his Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>Above all he thanked God most devoutly that
he was the strongest man in Southern Wisconsin
and could provide for and protect his womenfolks
and cattle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pn p1">"Stop the team a minute," Peter told Gus.
He looked down upon the white-roofed house
and barns, the frozen creek, strawstacks like giant
mushrooms capped with white, the drifted hedgerows
interlaced with rabbit tracks, Lake Koshkonong
like a floor of green glass surrounded by
its gnarled forests of black, leafless oaks.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Gus asked. "Had a fight
with your girl?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't understand."</p>

<p>"Don't trust no woman farther'n you could
throw a horse," counseled the hired man.</p>

<p>"I told her that if she went off to her Grandmother's
in Madison over Christmas she could
stay away for good."</p>

<p>"And so she went!"</p>

<p>"How'd you know?"</p>

<p>"Any woman would."</p>

<p>"Damn her," said Peter. "No, I don't mean
that." He wondered why he was confiding in
Gus. No one else to confide in, really.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just act like she doesn't exist," said Gus. "Go
ahead and have a good time without her. She'll
come crawling back on her belly."</p>

<p>"You don't know this girl."</p>

<p>"Maybe not this one," Gus admitted, "but
they're all cats out of the same litter."</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"You home, boy?" Stud asked.</p>

<p>Early Ann helped Peter off with his coat and
chucked him under the chin.</p>

<p>"Trailer factory's shut down, Dad. They're
losing money."</p>

<p>"Shut down for good?"</p>

<p>"Start up again the first of the year more'n
likely."</p>

<p>"What'd you do if the 'Trailer' shut down for
good?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, Father."</p>

<p>"Might you come back to the farm?"</p>

<p>"I might," said the boy, averting his eyes.</p>

<p>Four days until Christmas. The house was already
decorated with holly and red bells. There
were frost flowers on the window panes and the
base burner glowed brightly. His mother was
sitting before the stove in her favorite rocker
piecing a quilt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's lots of rabbits this year," Sarah
said. She thought: I don't want him to kill rabbits.
I hate trapping, hunting, and slaughtering.
It made me sick the time I saw Stanley castrating
the little boars.</p>

<p>"I'll have a good time, Mother," Peter said.
He thought: why shouldn't I have a good time.
Maxine probably lets half the boys in Brailsford
Junction kiss her.</p>

<p>"We haven't had a good rabbit stew all season,"
Sarah said. She thought: I used to tell him
stories about every piece in the quilt. What dress
it came from and where I wore it. This piece is
out of the brown silk I took along on my honeymoon.
I wore it that night we rowed out on Lake
Mendota and saw the dome of the capitol at
Madison shining in the moonlight. I wonder if
Stanley remembers.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty quilt," Peter said. He
thought: she used to tell me stories about the
pieces she was sewing. I wish she would again.</p>

<p>"See, it's a flower design," she said. She
thought: he's grown up now. He wouldn't want
to listen.</p>

<p>"I got the drawings for my camp trailer done,
Ma," he said. He thought: I'll do something
great for Mother when I'm rich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure Mr. O'Casey will build one," she
said. She thought: then he'll be gone forever.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," Peter said. He thought: if
the "Trailer" shuts down I'll probably have to
come back to the farm and be glad of the
chance.</p>

<p>Sarah thought: I want to know every little
thing about his life&mdash;how he gets on at the factory,
how Temperance Crandall takes care of
him, whether he smokes or drinks, whether he's
a good boy and goes to church, or whether he
hangs around the pool hall. I want to know about
Maxine Larabee. But I don't dare ask. It would
frighten him still farther away.</p>

<p>The needle clicked against the thimble. The
silk rustled in Sarah's hands. Coal crackled in the
stove and the wind whispered at the corners of
the house. After a while the smell of roasting
chicken drifted in from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"You're getting to be a big boy," she said.
She thought: I wanted him to stay little forever.
I wanted to keep him close to me, but he's grown
so far away.</p>

<p>"I'm more than six feet," the boy said. He
thought: it's beautiful with Maxine. I can't get
along without her any more. I'm a man now and
know all there is to know about women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah was startled looking into his face. She
thought: why, he isn't my little boy. He's a
stranger.</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">That night at supper&mdash;chicken, dressing, cranberry
sauce, mashed potatoes, giblet gravy, hot
mince pie and coffee&mdash;Stud waved a drumstick
while orating just what he would do if Joe Valentine
came across the Brailsford line again.</p>

<p>Still grasping the drumstick he assumed a fighting
pose which would have startled John L. Sullivan,
the strong boy from Boston.</p>

<p>"I can't sleep nights for thinking of that terrible
man," Sarah confessed.</p>

<p>"Why don't we chase him off the Point?"
Peter asked.</p>

<p>"Or have the law on him?" suggested Gus.</p>

<p>"I'll shoot him if I ever get a chance," Early
Ann cried passionately.</p>

<p>"Leave him to me," Stud told the rest of the
family. "He ain't harmful. He's got a right to
live the same as we have. We ain't going to shoot
him or have the law on him, or run him off the
Point. But if he comes across our line again I'll
give him a real licking."</p>

<p>"Give him a couple of extra punches for me,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
said Early Ann. "I wish I was a man. I'll bet I
could lick him."</p>

<p>"And meanwhile," said Stud, "it's almost
Christmas day. We'll have to take him some
victuals for his Christmas dinner,&mdash;something
for the Olesons and the Widow Morrison, too.
We'll do it tonight."</p>

<p>"Drive over to Lake House Point at night?"
Gus asked in dismay.</p>

<p>"Scared cat," taunted Early Ann.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of myself," said Gus, "I
was just worrying about the womenfolks."</p>

<p>Early Ann tittered.</p>

<p>After supper they put on sheepskin coats and
mufflers, filled a bob-sleigh with pecks of potatoes,
bags of apples, three small picnic hams, and some
canned fruit. They sat in the deep straw covered
with fur robes and went gayly down the road to
the tumble-down Oleson shack.</p>

<p>"They're Svenskies," said Stud, "but they're
better neighbors than some civilized people." He
poked Gus in the ribs to emphasize the taunt.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be a Scandihoovian than a gol darn
beef-eating Englishman," sniffed Gus.</p>

<p>It made Sarah sad to see how grateful Hilda
Oleson was for the presents. Ole Oleson was
sullen as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay t'ink next yar Ay vill gif you sometink
to eat, ya?" He puffed vigorously at his corncob,
and continued to carve his ship model.</p>

<p>The rosy Hilda, all aflutter, began to apologize
for the state of her house which was as spotless
as a new pan. She led them in on tiptoe to see
young Ole, who would be a year old in a few
months now. He lay with his small, plump arms
thrown above his head, his lips working busily as
he dreamed of Hilda's breast. The lamp light
made a halo of his blond fuzz, shone upon his
pink cheeks and his long eyelashes. The soft spot
on his head beat rhythmically with his pulse. He
stirred, made a lusty sucking noise with his mouth,
opened his big blue eyes, and began to cry for his
evening nursing.</p>

<p>Sarah, as always in the presence of a baby,
mourned her age. Stud was frankly envious; Gus,
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"It seems like yesterday you were this size,"
Sarah told the discomfited Peter.</p>

<p>Hilda put the baby in Sarah's arms, and he began
to nuzzle at her shrunken breasts. Quick
tears sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Ve yoost love little Ole," Hilda whispered to
Sarah as they returned to the other room. "Ay
t'ink anudder kom pretty soon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Ole senior brightened, seeing the Brailsfords
gathered around his son. He helped his wife to
serve coffee cake and coffee, and when the visitors
were leaving forced them to take a beautiful little
full-rigged ship with a Norse figurehead at its
prow. They had never seen such exquisite carving.
He followed them to the door, and called
after them, "Tack sa mycket ... thanks,
thanks."</p>

<p>They were only a few minutes at the Widow
Morrison's, then went jingling through the snowy
moonlight down the all but overgrown road to
Lake House Point. They crossed the corduroy
stretch bordered by leafless willow trees and
climbed the rutted, precipitous lane which rose
through scrub oak and hazel brush to the old
hunting lodge. As they reached the kitchen door
the light went out, and although Stud went boldly
in and called Joe Valentine no one answered.
They unloaded the food and carried it into the
dark kitchen, then turned the horses toward home
and went plunging down the hill,&mdash;sparks flying
from the sharp-shod hooves.</p>

<p>One evening they went hunting rabbits in the
moonlight to test out the new shotgun which
Temperance had given Peter as a pre-dated
Christmas present, and the next night all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
young folks for miles gathered for a bob-sleigh
party.</p>

<p>Coming home at three in the morning through
a white, silent world Early Ann rested her head
on Peter's shoulder. The moon was going down in
the west throwing long shadows from fenceposts
and trees. The tired horses walked slowly, blowing
steam from their frosty nostrils. Peter slipped
his arm around Early Ann and she did not take
it away. He kissed her as they turned in at the
farm and she returned the kiss.</p>

<p>But he was happy that next morning she made
no allusions to their love-making. Instead she
challenged him to a skating race and they battled
eagerly across the bay with the wind stinging
their cheeks and their skates ringing.</p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">On Christmas Eve the whole family helped to
decorate the Christmas tree. They pinned their
socks and stockings to the branches and each in
turn played surreptitious Santa Claus. Such
rare luxuries as oranges and English walnuts were
stuffed into bags of red netting, and these in turn
were shoved into the foot of each stocking. A
very few inexpensive but thoughtful gifts were
wrapped in tissue paper and tied with silver ribbons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Stud had the worst of it, trying to tie pretty
bow knots with his large, blunt fingers.</p>

<p>They gathered about the organ and sang Christmas
carols while Sarah played. Beginning with
such semi-frivolous songs as "Jingle Bells" and
"Deck the Halls with Wreaths of Holly," they
progressed to the more moving hymns such as
"Hark, the Herald Angels Sing," and "Silent
Night, Holy Night." Sarah's sweet soprano,
Stud's deep bass, Early Ann's husky alto, and
Peter's clear baritone joined to praise the Mother
and Child who one thousand nine hundred and
thirteen years before had occupied a manger in
Bethlehem.</p>

<p>On that same Christmas Eve, Joe Whalen and
Kate Barton who had been respectively pumping
and playing the Methodist pipe organ since their
late teens decided to elope to Janesville. Kate
had finally induced Joe to take the temperance
pledge, but he felt that a quart of rye was imperative
to celebrate his coming nuptials.</p>

<p>Temperance Crandall lit the candle in her front
window. She could hear the children singing at
the church, but she did not cross the street to
attend the cantata. After a while she blew out the
candle, stoked the fire, went up the cold, dark
stairs to her bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>On a Pullman sleeper roaring toward New
York, Mike O'Casey awoke from a fretful sleep,
pulled up the blind, and found he was in Cleveland.
Christmas carollers were making an ungodly
racket on the station platform. He made obscene
remarks about the whole idea of Christmas as well
as the fool notion of attempting to run a trailer
factory in Brailsford Junction. His friend O'Hallohan,
the New York banker, would have to
sign his note for fifty thousand dollars, or he
would tell Tammany what he knew about O'Hallohan.</p>

<p>To the tune of the "Junkman Rag" Maxine
Larabee was dancing the night away in Madison,
Wisconsin, with a Beta from the University of
Wisconsin who would presently know the last
word on legumes, rotation of crops, and soil analysis.
She was very sleepy the next morning
when her wealthy grandmother came into her bedroom
crying "Merry Christmas."</p>

<p>From the windows where he sat brooding Joe
Valentine could see the Brailsford home ablaze
with Christmas. A plan began to take form in
his slow mind. If Stud Brailsford thought that
he could buy him with a few groceries he was
badly mistaken. Joe never forgot. He hadn't
forgotten that nigger who had knifed him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Rockford, Illinois. Some black woman was probably
still hunting for that shine.</p>

<p>And Stud Brailsford&mdash;when the others were
in bed&mdash;went out with his lantern to take a last
look at the barns. The ponies drowsed in their
box stalls, the big bull's eyes glowed in the lantern
light. Stud stopped to pet the stallion and
the twin Percheron colts. One of those twins
would some day make a great sire.</p>

<p>He noticed that the stars were very large and
bright above his barn that night.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>During 1913 the Palace of Peace at The Hague
was dedicated. War and cholera swept the Balkans.
The munition works prospered as Germany
and France greatly increased their standing
armies. Irish Home Rule agitators and militant
suffragettes made life miserable for British statesmen.
Forty million American church-goers gave
four hundred million dollars to religious organizations.
American junkers and the oil interests
wanted armed intervention in Mexico. Pavlowa
in a syndicated newspaper feature taught America
the tango and other popular steps, while Aunt
Prudence in her advice to the lovelorn sternly
counseled "Anxious" against kissing any man but
the one she intended to marry....</i></p>


<p class="pn p1">But to Peter Brailsford, enamored of woman,
a trifle uncertain of his newly attained maturity,
six feet tall, his muscles swelling toward the gigantic
proportions of his father's, his chest deepening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and his mind exploring ever more distant
horizons....</p>

<p>To this big healthy product of Southern Wisconsin
the year's-end meant but one thing. He
was invited to supper and a New Year's Eve celebration
at Maxine Larabee's home, and he was
determined to create the right impression in the
household of Brailsford Junction's leading attorney.</p>

<p>There was little doubt that he was correctly
attired, his table manners would pass muster&mdash;though
he must remember not to tuck his napkin
in his vest&mdash;and he had learned by rote what
he was going to say when he spoke to Attorney
Larabee about marrying Maxine.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the big fellow trembled as he
was admitted into the magnificence of the Larabee
home with its golden-oak mission furniture,
its wilton carpets and its beaded portieres. Mrs.
Larabee descended upon him plump, pink, and
gushing. Maxine laughed musically as she gave
him her hand, but Attorney Larabee merely
grunted a hello from behind his paper and rolled
his cigar into the other corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>Peter felt depressed.</p>

<p>Despite Maxine's rendition (at her mother's
request) of "Too Much Mustard," and "I've Got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
a Pain in My Sawdust," with other instrumental
and vocal numbers. Despite comic postcards
showing vegetables the size of freight cars, Fords
no larger than insects, and the romantic series
by Harrison Fisher entitled "Six Periods in a
Girl's Life." Despite such notable diversions as
a Chinese puzzle and a set of views showing the
Grand Cañon in its actual colors&mdash;</p>

<p>Peter felt depressed.</p>

<p>Supper was served at last. After the blessing,
soup was ladled from a tureen embossed with
lilacs into soup bowls of the same design. And
with the soup came the deluge:</p>

<p>"I understand you want to marry my daughter,"
boomed Mr. Larabee.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir," Peter admitted, looking into
the green, viscous liquid in his bowl and feeling
ill.</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to support her in the manner
to which...."</p>

<p>"Now, Charles," said Mrs. Larabee, "you were
as poor as a church mouse when you asked me."</p>

<p>"Mother!" said the stern head of the house, "I
will take care of this."</p>

<p>Mrs. Larabee slipped back into the soft and
matronly sea of pink chiffon from which she had
momentarily arisen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you realize," said Attorney Larabee,
"that Maxine comes from one of Brailsford
Junction's first families...."</p>

<p>"They named the town after a Brailsford,"
blurted Peter. "My dad's the biggest stock
breeder in Rock County. And I've got the best
chance in the world to be a great inventor or
something.... And, well, anyhow I love her,"
he finished weakly.</p>

<p>"Hmmm, hmmm," said Mr. Larabee. "I shall
have to think about it."</p>

<p>Fuming, and scarcely touching his supper,
Peter managed somehow to last out the eternity
between soup and pie. He wished violently that
he might forget for a moment that Mr. Larabee
was Maxine's father so that he could give him
the beating he so richly deserved. He wondered
how it was possible that anyone so delightful
as Maxine could be the daughter of such a conceited,
bigoted old thundercloud as Attorney Larabee
and his addle-pated wife.</p>

<p>At last the meal was over. Mrs. Larabee was
remorseful, but announced that she and Mr.
Larabee could not stay for the young folks'
party. They could scarcely turn down the Billings
who had invited them over for the evening.</p>

<p>Peter waited until the old folks were gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
then with rapidly beating heart went up the
stairs and slipped into Maxine's bedroom where
the girl was dressing for the party.</p>

<p>She was in bloomers and silk shirt and was
pulling on her stockings.</p>

<p>"Go away, Peter," she said. "No, no ... I
can't."</p>

<p>He sat on the edge of the bed watching her
moodily as she dressed and primped before the
mirror. She could turn his heart inside out with
the least gesture of her lovely hands. The way
she threw back her curls as she combed her hair,
the way she tilted her chin as she looked at herself
in the mirror! He was mad about her, and
she was as cool as a cucumber.</p>

<p>It had been in this very room that they had
been together that night. They had lain, listening
to the wind scattering the leaves in a shower
across the roof; hearing the distant clop, clop of
horses' hooves. They had almost been caught
when the Larabee automobile had turned in at
the drive half an hour previous to their expectations.
Peter had slipped out a side door not a
minute too soon. He had been tying his tie when
he was a block down the street.</p>

<p>"I guess you're getting tired of me," Peter said
with a lump in his throat. "I guess you'll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
making love to some other fellow one of these
days."</p>

<p>"How dare you, Peter Brailsford!" she cried,
taking the hairpins out of her mouth and turning
to glare at him. "Suggesting that it might be
any boy like that. What kind of a girl do you
think I am?"</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to wonder," Peter admitted,
shocked at his frankness.</p>

<p>"Don't be tiresome," said the pretty girl, giving
a final pat to her hair. "Do you think anybody
will notice if I don't wear a corset? I
simply loathe corsets."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am tiresome," said Peter, gloomily.</p>

<p>"Oh, shush!" said Maxine. "I asked you a
question."</p>

<p>"Wear whatever you please," Peter said.</p>

<p>"Why, Peter Brailsford," cried Maxine.
"You're simply horrid. Now do be a good boy
and help me with these hooks and eyes. I never
can get them by myself."</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">When he could no longer stand the uncertainty,
Peter Brailsford made his excuses to Milly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Vincent,&mdash;she of the silly lisp and carrot-colored
hair. He stalked from the room while the piano
and violin played Strauss, ascended the dark
stairs, and stood at the landing watching the
clouds scudding across the face of the moon.</p>

<p>The sound of laughter and dancing feet floated
up to the unhappy boy. He heard the Strauss
waltz vaguely.</p>

<p>He said that he would go away to some other
town where no one would know him. He would
go to Chicago or even New York. He would go
to the farthest ends of the earth and forget that
there had ever been a town named Brailsford
Junction or a girl named Maxine.</p>

<p>After a few moments he turned from the
window and ascended quietly to the upper hall.
Scarcely breathing, he put his ear to Maxine's
bedroom door. All that he could hear was the
throbbing of his own pulse in his ears.</p>

<p>Bud Spillman and Maxine had been drinking.
He had seen them slip away together half an hour
before, and they had not come back. If he found
them together he knew that he would kill them
and then himself.</p>

<p>There! The rustle of silk. And now their
voices and quiet laughter.</p>

<p>Strangely, he was not angry now. All of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
fury was suddenly drained away and he felt
empty and shaken. He was amazed to find that
the violin was still playing the Strauss waltz.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pn p1">On a steel-cold January morning with the
frozen lake booming and the wind whining along
the telephone wires&mdash;a morning so cold that the
pump in the kitchen was frozen and three inches
of ice capped the stock tanks&mdash;the Brailsfords
rolled out at four to begin butchering. They
left the deep warmth of their feather-beds, came
down the narrow, precipitous back stairs worn
in hollows by years of weary feet.</p>

<p>Early Ann thawed the pump with hot water
from the tea kettle; Sarah started the oatmeal,
ham and eggs, toast and coffee. Gus scratched
a peep-hole in the hoar frost on the window pane
and looked out into the ten-below moonlight.</p>

<p>"It's a cold day to butcher," Sarah said.
"Mightn't we wait a few days, Stanley?"</p>

<p>"Hank Vetter says he ain't got a pork chop
left in his shop."</p>

<p>"I suppose if we must, we must."</p>

<p>The men pulled on arctics, wrapped red mufflers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
about their necks, drew on their worn dogskin
coats and fur caps, and taking milk pails
and lanterns went out to the barns. They had
no time this morning to carry water for the stock.
They chopped holes in the ice on the tanks; drove
the animals out to drink. The water froze as it
streamed from the beasts' lips. Breath froze in
white clouds about the horses' nostrils. The great
bull, led by the nose, bellowed and snorted in the
lantern light. The horses' hooves rang on the
frozen mud of the barnyard.</p>

<p>"It's a rip snorter today," said Stud, coming
in from the barns. He warmed his hands over
the roaring stove.</p>

<p>Sarah dipped him hot water from the reservoir
and poured it into the wash basin. She hung his
coat toward the fire to keep it warm, and hastened
to serve the breakfast. While they ate they
argued the all-important problem of which animals
were to die; and by five-thirty they were
ready to begin the day's work.</p>

<p>Sarah, steeling herself for the ordeal; Early
Ann, who pretended she did not mind slaughtering;
Gus, who had a sentimental fondness for
every animal on the place; and Stud, for whom
this day was the climax of the hog-raising season,
trooped down the hill to the slaughter house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
started a fire in the stove, and carried water to
fill the great iron kettle just outside the slaughter house
door.</p>

<p>Stud began whetting his knives on his butcher's
steel, making a sound which cut through
Sarah's flesh like a blade. He liked to whet
knives. And he could not deny it, he liked to
slaughter. He had the finest butchering equipment
of any farmer on Lake Koshkonong. Sticking,
boning, and skinning knives in their rack&mdash;the
steel blades and brass studs in the rosewood
handles gleaming in the lantern light; the biggest
butchering kettle in the township; the best
pair of hand-wrought gambrels, hung from the
finest reel on the strongest hickory axle.</p>

<p>Some farmers still carried away the blood in
buckets, but Brailsford had built himself a slanting
trough. His heavy cleavers with their hickory
handles, his meat saws, hog hooks, scrapers,
chopping block and sausage machine were the
best that money could buy.</p>

<p>As always, Sarah felt an agony which she
would not show. She could not understand that
quality in Stanley which made him enjoy killing,&mdash;enjoy
going out at night to knock the
sparrows out of their nests in the straw to wring
the necks of the drowsy, blinded birds. At haying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
time, too, he was careless of the rabbits and half-grown
quail as he drove his mower through the
timothy and clover. Sometimes when she lay
beside him at night she thought of his God-like
power to give life and to take it away.</p>

<p>Sarah's job on the farm was to feed, nurse and
tenderly raise. She supposed that Stud must kill.
And yet it frightened her to think that she and
her family were no more secure from death than
these animals. When the time came God would
take them all as easily and with as little ceremony.</p>

<p>"Go get the hogs," Stud shouted to Gus.
"And, Early Ann, you start the fire under the
kettle."</p>

<p>Out of their warm hog house the pigs and
sows were driven by the hired man's boots. They
were herded across the pig yard, littered with
thousands of corn cobs from the tons of corn
they had eaten. They went in a complaining,
squealing drove past the soul-satisfying mudholes
(now frozen) where they had wallowed during
the summer. They grunted and clambered over
one another as they were shunted into the slaughter house.</p>

<p class="b1">Early Ann, meanwhile, was starting the great
fire of hickory and oak under the black iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
kettle mounted on its tripod. The red and yellow
flames licked up around the kettle, made a scene
in the darkness which might have accompanied
an early witchburning on the wind-swept New
England shore. Sarah was singing a hymn as
she cleaned the sausage machine:</p>

<p class="ppq20">"<i>Sweet the Sabbath morning,<br />
Cool and bright returning....</i>"</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Then:</p>

<p class="ppq10">"<i>The lovely spring has come at last;<br />
The rain is o'er, the winter past....</i>"</p>

<p class="p1">"Bring them on," cried Stud. He stripped off
his mittens, picked up the big sledge, spit on his
hands and rubbed them on the smooth, yellow
hickory handle. He tested his strength with a
couple of preparatory swings, striking the sledge
against the base of the twelve-by-twelve hickory
upright in the center of the building. His blows
shook the roof.</p>

<p>"Send me a big one, Gus."</p>

<p>The squealing of the pigs had by this time
become terrific. The crackle of the flames in the
fire under the kettle, the thud of Stanley's sledge,
the shouts of Gus herding the pigs, the sweet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
clear notes of Sarah's singing filled the great, old
building.</p>

<p>"Send me a big one, Gus. We'd better get going.
It's lighting up in the east."</p>

<p>Just as the edge of the sun appeared, sparkling
like red fire across five miles of frozen lake, Gus
lifted the narrow sliding door and booted a sow
through the opening. "Crack, crack" went the
big sledge on the sow's skull. The pigs screamed
and plunged about in their pens. Quickly, now,
they hooked the gambrels through the tenons of
her hind legs, heaved and sweat on the big pulley,
lifted the sow clear of the floor and snubbed the
rope around a post. Stud reached for his sticking
knife, slit the sow's throat; the blood poured into
the trough beneath. There were horrid sounds
of breath gurgling through the slit throat.</p>

<p>All day they labored. They slaughtered six
hogs and two young steers, cleaned sausage casings,
ground and stuffed sausage, coiled it in tubs
carefully. They scalded pigs and scraped them
white and smooth, then hung them up to freeze.
They set aside a pail of blood for blood pudding
and blood gravy.</p>

<p>Stud sweat like a draft horse despite the chill
of the building. His big muscles worked like fine,
heavy machinery. He was as happy as a lark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
until they drove Ulysses S. Grant into the slaughtering
pen. Then his heart misgave him.</p>

<p>Ulysses, whom he had raised and tended so
carefully. Ulysses whom he had displayed so
proudly at fair after fair. The great boar whom
he loved and hated, pampered and fought. But
it could not be helped. His breeding days were
over. He was fierce and dangerous. A menace
to have about the farm. Ulysses Jr. would have
to take his place.</p>

<p>The boar's eyes gleamed wickedly as he stood
with feet apart, waiting. He smelled the blood,
but he did not scream. He was ready for his last
fight and unafraid.</p>

<p>Stud trembled as he spit on his hands and
picked up the heavy mall.</p>

<p>"Let him come, Gus. Get out of the way,
girls."</p>

<p>He raised the sledge high above his head and
brought it down with every ounce of his strength
squarely between the animal's eyes.</p>

<p>Then he dropped the sledge to the ground and
cried like a baby.</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Stud Brailsford paced the house like a caged
bear. The family was snowbound, and the enforced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
idleness made the big man restless and
moody.</p>

<p>For three days the snow had fallen burdening
the trees, drifting three feet deep against the
parlor windows, making it necessary to light the
lamps at two each afternoon. Day and night the
wind and snow poured in torrents down the Rock
River valley, lifted in hissing spirals to strike
against the house.</p>

<p>Stud had tried reading. He had mended and
oiled harness, shucked corn, shoveled snow for
hours every day. He had played a dozen games
of checkers with the hired man. Still he was
restless.</p>

<p>Coming upon Early Ann in the back pantry
he pulled her roughly to him and kissed her full
on the mouth. She broke away but she did not
cry out. She looked at him bewildered, hurt, and
tearful.</p>

<p>Stud was ashamed. He hung his head and
went through into the kitchen where Sarah helped
him off with his boots and put on his slippers.
He knew now what was troubling him. He lay
on the sofa with his eyes closed, pretending to
sleep, but in reality thinking of Early Ann.</p>

<p>What a picture the girl was, her eyes bright
and cheeks glowing! Stud liked to watch her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
churning the cream (which they could not deliver
because of the blizzard). He liked to watch
her poring over the geography book to learn the
state capitals and the principal rivers of the
United States. Her fingers flew deftly as she
tatted a yoke for a fancy nightgown. Stud wished
he were still in his twenties.</p>

<p>As Stud lay brooding on the sofa, Gus burst
in with the exciting news that the mailman had
broken through and had brought the new mail-order
catalogue. Nothing short of this miracle
could have brightened the sad day for
Stanley.</p>

<p>The new Sears Roebuck catalogue! It was a
gala event. Let the snow drift, stars fall, or
nations vanish. The Brailsfords did not care.
They gathered around Stud who hastily tore the
wrapping from "The Farmer's Bible" and opened
it on the kitchen table.</p>

<p>Stanley, as always, turned to the buggies,
wagons and harnesses. He had a Ford, it was
true, but his first love had been the buggy. He
sighed deeply as he viewed the spanking new
surreys, phaëtons, runabouts, Concords and buckboards.
He especially coveted buggy number
11R720, a veritable dream in buggy manufacture
illustrated in full color. This swank creation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
which the catalogue disclosed had been especially
designed for eastern customers, had drop axles,
green cloth cushions, triple-braced shaft, and
flashing red wheels. Even as steamboat captains
must sometimes dream of smart clipper ships, so
Stud Brailsford, owner of a Ford, exclaimed aloud
over this beautiful mail order buggy&mdash;1914
model.</p>

<p>He decided that his stallion, who had recently
had a touch of colic, needed more exercise, and
within ten minutes had filled out an order for
a skeleton road cart of sturdy design. He lingered
over the new cream separators, bright red gasoline
engines, ornamental fences, milk cans, lanterns,
and one of the most inspiring manure spreaders
which ever spread manure. The 1914 catalogue
was epochal in the life of this big farmer.</p>

<p>When Sarah and Early Ann were given a
chance to look between the covers they devoured
the sections on clothes, jewelry, silverware and
kitchen equipment. With dreaming eyes they
caressed the lavallières engraved with roses,
doves, and hearts; the real diamond rings flashing
blue fire; the Parisian toilet sets elaborately
hand-painted, monogrammed, and including two
sizes of what were politely known as combinets.
Perfumes, soaps, conch shells, and "high-class,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
hand-painted pictures inset with mother-of-pearl"
transported them to fairy land.</p>

<p>Their senses starved with drab reality, they
viewed with hungry eyes hats dangling red cherries,
grapes, stuffed birds and ostrich plumes.
They lusted for the dainty nightgowns, embroidered
underwear, stylish coats and dresses, rococo
silver, and exotic wall paper they might never
own.</p>

<p>"I sure do wish I had one of them blue enamel
coal-oil stoves," said Sarah. "It'd be a real blessing
in hot weather."</p>

<p>"I'll make out the order right now," Stanley
said, remembering guiltily how he had kissed
Early Ann in the back pantry.</p>

<p>"You're too good to me, Stanley, I don't
deserve it."</p>

<p>Early Ann said she was going to buy herself a
pair of navy blue high-button velvet shoes with
flexible cushion soles. They could be had for
two dollars and twenty-five cents, only a quarter
more than it would cost to buy a sensible pair.</p>

<p>"And I'm going to get the family a sugarbowl-with-teaspoon-rack
for the center of the table,
and some new sheet music for the organ."</p>

<p>"You save your money, young lady," Stanley
warned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Personally Gus wished he had a bulldog so that
he might buy dog collar 6R6268, ablaze with
brass and imitation topaz. Then with a college-shaped
meerschaum pipe, a cane, a green suit and
yellow gloves he would go calling upon the new
school teacher. If that didn't impress her he
didn't know what would.</p>

<p>When no one else was around he hastily turned
to the section displaying corsets and women's
underwear. He had never seen anything like it.
Montgomery Ward's didn't have half as many
big, blooming girls in lace-trimmed drawers,
union suits, princess slips, corsets, and corset
covers. He had never seen so many stylish stouts
with blossoming cheeks and magnificent buttocks.
The moment he dared he would carefully cut
out whole pages of those colorful girls, particularly
the smiling matron whose union suit was
described as "snug fitting with flaring umbrella
bottom."</p>

<p>"Gee," said Gus, "I'd like to have one of everything
in this catalogue."</p>

<p>Life could be lived in those days, as it can
now, without stepping off the farm for so much
as a length of ribbon. You could "laugh yourself
to death" for fourteen cents by perusing "On a
Slow Train Through Arkansas," "Through New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Hampshire on a Buckboard," or "I'm From
Texas, You Can't Steer Me." You could buy&mdash;and
still can&mdash;hay forks, Wilton carpets adorned
with large red roses, slide trombones, butter paddles,
post card albums, cylinder records, or magic
lanterns for a relatively trifling sum.</p>

<p>And never before in the history of civilization
was seen such a display of hammocks, guns,
cuckoo clocks, home remedies, feather dusters,
folding tubs, bust forms, pacifiers, bed pans,
trusses, windmills, lard presses, hornless talking
machines and morris chairs. Ben Hur's famous
chariot race enlivened a full page in color, while
the devout could purchase the Bible for as little
as sixty-three cents.</p>

<p>They did not care if the storm was raging outside.
They did not care that they were snowbound.
They were living in the romantic world
of the mail order catalogue where they were all
as rich as kings, where every woman wore a beautiful
new dress and every man was handsome and
stylish, where there were bonbons and books and
beautiful buggies.</p>

<p>"Well, now that we've got the new catalogue,
we know where we can put the old one," said
Gus, winking at Stud.</p>

<p>Sarah blushed and Early Ann giggled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>On the stairs that night, Stanley again caught
Early Ann and kissed her. The girl fought
silently but furiously to free herself, and it was
during the struggle that Sarah came upon them.</p>

<p>Stud's wife was suddenly overborne with her
age, her fragility, and her helplessness. For a
moment she was jealous, angry with them both,
and bitter. The following moment she was
thinking of Stanley and wondering if he weren't
entitled to be faithless just once in his life. Sarah
felt that she would be the last person in the
world to keep another from happiness. Then she
remembered Early Ann, and she was afraid for
the girl as though she had been her own daughter.
Heartsick, frightened, but determined to face the
issue; lost, bewildered, so in love with Stanley
that it hurt her in the pit of her stomach,&mdash;Sarah,
in that long moment before she spoke experienced
half a life-time of sorrow, and the despair of
millions of women of her age, standing in lamplight
on the worn stairs, looking a little older.</p>

<p>"You might at least think of Early Ann,"
she said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Shortly after midnight Peter was awakened
with lantern light in his eyes, and he sprang out
of bed, smelling the fog and knowing that case
weather had come.</p>

<p>He stumbled into his overalls and followed
his father and Gus down the stairs and out into
the yard where Vern Barton, Dutchy Bloom and
others were waiting. The fog was so thick that
a man might have lost his way in his own barnyard.
The lanterns looked like fox fire at twenty
feet.</p>

<p>Stud led the way and the others followed,
Indian file, down the slushy lane to the tobacco
sheds. The mist, which had rolled northward
flooding the valley from hilltop to hilltop, enveloped
them in a thick, white blanket, muffled
their footsteps, and drowned their voices with
its weight of silence. Once when the fog lifted
momentarily Peter could see lights at other farm
houses, other lanterns moving, the whole countryside
astir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Stud rolled back the doors of the tobacco shed
on creaking rollers and the men flowed in through
the wide, dark opening, went up among the
beams, began methodically and rapidly to lower
the heavily-laden laths of tobacco to the men
below who piled them log-cabin fashion on the
dirt floor. Not a moment could be lost. Tobacco
leaves which had been as brittle as spun glass five
hours before were now as pliable as brown satin.
Before a cold wind could lift the fog, again freezing
the leaves, the men must pile and protect tons
of tobacco. Later it would be stripped from the
stalk, bundled and hauled to the warehouses of
the tobacco buyers in Brailsford Junction.</p>

<p>There was a breath of false spring in the air.
The huge shadows cast by the men sprang up
the walls and fell noiselessly. And Peter, surefooted
as a cat among the beams, was jousting
with shadows while he worked. Would he come
back to the farm if this ten day layoff were extended,
or would he catch a train for Chicago?
Where would he forget Maxine the more easily?
Where would he find happiness again?</p>

<p>On this night of fog, smelling of oak woods,
of thawing earth and maple sap; surrounded by
men he had known since childhood; watching his
father moving gigantically in lantern light, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
wrestled with his problems. What if the
"Trailer" shut down for good as it easily might?
Would he come back to this farm where his father
and grandfather had labored before him, inherit
these woods and fields, and marshes? Hunt ducks
in the fall, plow the land in the spring, help at
the birthing of calves and lambs and foals? He
would introduce new machinery, build a new
house, perhaps, high on one of the hills. Almost
he was resigned to the idea. He thought his fate
could have been worse.</p>

<p>Shortly before dawn, Early Ann came with
black coffee and thick sausage sandwiches and
slabs of buttered coffee cake. The men ate greedily
after the hard night's work. They paid crude
compliments to the girl who stood with graniteware
coffeepot waiting to refill their cups.</p>

<p>Early Ann had brought something special for
Peter. When none of the others were looking
she slipped a little white hickorynut cake with
white frosting into Peter's dirty hand.</p>

<p>"You take the first bite," he said, holding the
cake to her lips.</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>When his ten days were up Peter almost wished
that he did not have to go back to the factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
again. He had been tinkering around with the
thrashing machine, oiling the parts and tightening
a nut here and there. He hoped that he might
be thrashing boss again next summer.</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">"You might at least think of Early Ann,"
Stud's wife had said. He <i>had</i> thought of her until
his spirit was tired, argued the problem with himself,
tossed in his sleep.</p>

<p>Now he was almost happy to have another
grievance to occupy his mind. Momentarily Early
Ann was forgotten.</p>

<p>The Percheron had been grained too heavily
and had not been given sufficient exercise. What
else might be the matter with the great beast, the
Lord alone knew.</p>

<p>"You and me, both!" Stud said to the sick
stallion. "I wish all I had the matter with me
was a belly ache."</p>

<p>Doc Carlyle was out of town, so it was up
to Brailsford to save the horse,&mdash;no easy task.
Teddy Roosevelt's head drooped almost to the
floor; his big, shining barrel was blown, and his
eyes were dull and lifeless. As Stanley and Gus
stood watching the unfortunate animal he suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
jerked up his head, pawed the floor, and
tried to climb into the manger with his front
feet.</p>

<p>"Poor old bastard," said Gus.</p>

<p>"Run get the pig bladder and elder shoot,"
Stanley said. "I'll fix some turpentine and linseed
oil."</p>

<p>The turpentine made the stallion frantic. He
broke into a cold sweat, plunged around and
around his pen, threw himself down with a crash,
rolled over and got up again, dashed headlong
into the planks of his stall, stood on his hind legs
pawing the air wildly, screamed and foamed at the
mouth, fell to the floor&mdash;his gigantic muscles contracting
spasmodically under his gleaming black
hide. There was a mad, frightened light in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"It'd be like losing a member of the family,"
Gus said.</p>

<p>"We've got to save him," Brailsford cried.
"Get Sarah to put over a boiler of water. And
bring the cayenne pepper and baking soda and
barbadoes aloes off the medicine shelf."</p>

<p>All night Stanley Brailsford worked over the
Percheron, carried steaming blankets to cover
the heaving body, forced whiskey down the terrified
animal's throat, tried to soothe the brute by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
petting him and talking to him as he would a sick
child. He fixed himself a bed on the feed box
and tried to snatch a few winks of sleep.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight a cold wind made the
lantern flicker. Stud Brailsford looked up to see
Early Ann with coffee pot and sandwiches.</p>

<p>"I couldn't sleep," she said. "How's the stallion?"</p>

<p>"Ain't kicking around so bad."</p>

<p>Early Ann gazed thoughtfully at the horse for
several moments.</p>

<p>"Probably stomach staggers," she said.</p>

<p>"How'd you know?"</p>

<p>"I've taken care of 'em before."</p>

<p>The man wolfed his sandwiches and drank his
scalding black coffee. Early Ann went into the
stall, dropped to her knees beside the stallion and
began to pet his quivering shoulder. His coat
was rumpled and full of straw, his heavy legs
listless. The girl got the curry comb and began
to curry very gently. She put a gunny-sack over
the Percheron's head to shade his eyes from the
lantern light.</p>

<p>"You're quite a hand with a sick stallion."</p>

<p>"Got to pamper 'em like you do all males."</p>

<p>"You'll make a great wife for some lucky
farmer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to try," the girl said earnestly.
"I'm sewing things against the day."</p>

<p>"Wish I was twenty years younger."</p>

<p>"That'd be two years before I was born."</p>

<p>They were silent for several minutes, Early
Ann currying the stallion, Stanley brooding and
munching his sandwiches. Once the Percheron
tried to get to his knees, then sank back wearily
in the straw.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right," Stanley told the big
animal. "You ain't going to die. You're a big
husky critter that can stand all kinds of belly
aches."</p>

<p>The girl picked up the coffee pot and started
for the door.</p>

<p>"Wait," the man said. He came quickly to her
side and put his arm around her. Trembling and
frightened she tried to get away. The rasping
breath of the stallion, the strange light, and the
huge arm around her waist made her feel faint.</p>

<p>"I can't," she said.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I can't do anything like that to Sarah, and
to you and me."</p>

<p>"No," the man said. "I suppose you can't."</p>

<p>After she had gone Stud tried to sleep, but
could not. Mice ventured out into the ring of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
light and nibbled at kernels of corn. The wind
shoved at the door and rattled the black window
panes. The animals stirred in their sleep, sighed
deeply, dreamed of lush green pastures.</p>

<p>At half past three in the morning the stallion
had another bad spell, and Stud thought he was
going to die. He wished that he had a hypodermic
needle so that he could puncture the gut at
the spot where it had become the most distended.
He felt helpless in the face of death. He pleaded
with the stallion not to die.</p>

<p>Strange how big male things could die so
easily. They were so strong and fiery and full
of life one moment and dead the next. You
could breed them to size, color, speed or endurance
but you couldn't breed them against death.
It made Stud Brailsford think of his own mortality
watching the stallion hour by hour. He
wished again that he could leave a dozen boys
to propagate his kind.</p>

<p>"Don't die," he said. "Don't die, big fellow."</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>All day they tended the stallion, and the next
night Stanley again insisted upon watching
throughout the night. This time Early Ann
brought coffee and sandwiches before the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of the family went to bed. Stanley said nothing
but pulled the girl roughly to him.</p>

<p>"No, no," she whispered. "Don't, Mr. Brailsford,
please. I ain't strong enough to fight you,
Stanley, please."</p>

<p>She began to cry, so he let her go, unharmed.
She did not leave immediately, but waited to
pour him another cup of coffee.</p>

<p>She wondered if he were asking too much, if
other girls were so virtuous. She wondered if
she should be kind to this unhappy man. But
before she could answer these questions they
saw the first flames and caught the smell of burning
hay.</p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">Looking back upon that night of wind and
gusty rain when the Brailsford barn burned like
a pile of dry shavings in a forest fire, Sarah sometimes
wondered what blind impulse had sent her
through the smoke and flames to save the twin
Percheron colts. She thought that perhaps it
was her feeling of protection for young things.
She couldn't bear to think of the colts being
burned.</p>

<p>"Save yourself, Mother," Brailsford had cried
above the roaring fire, struggling vainly to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the stallion; pleading, whipping and cajoling.
At last he left the inert sire, rushed to the box
stall of Napoleon and led the bull to safety.</p>

<p>"Help Gus with the cows down at the other
end," Stud shouted to his wife. "I'll get the
horses."</p>

<p>He went in among the fire-crazed mares and
geldings, old work horses who were faithful and
quiet in the field but who were now leaping, terrified,
wild animals, straining at their halter ropes,
pawing the floor, and shying like unbroken yearlings
at the thunder of the flames. Early Ann
led the three ponies into the tobacco shed, then
ran like the wind to the telephone in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Hurry, it's the Brailsford barn," she cried.
"Take the short cut over Barton's hill."</p>

<p>Vern Barton, Ole Oleson and Dutchy Bloom
were carrying water from the stock tanks. Sarah
and Gus were leading out the cows.</p>

<p>The big flames ran in sheets up the curving
walls of the wooden silo, burst like a volcano
through the peaked roof, cracked and thundered
like a kettle drum in the half-empty cylinder.
The resinous siding of the barn burned like a fire
of pine knots, kindling the hand-hewn oak and
hickory timbers cut from the forest with axe and
adz fifty years before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Cows bawled. Pigeons and sparrows shot out
like flaming rockets and fell into the fields.
Chickens squawked as they tumbled from the
building, ran around in circles like fighting cocks,
or flew back crazily into the scorching flames. A
mother cat carrying a singed kitten in her mouth
stalked out of the barn, her eyes gleaming like
green coals. Ganders added their hiss to the hiss
of the fire, men shouted and women screamed.</p>

<p>In the hub-bub that went on about him Stud
alone kept a clear head. He ordered the men to
form a bucket line, sent others for the spray
wagon which was used to throw a small stream on
the adjoining buildings, rushed in again and
again after horses. It was while he was leading
out the last, maddened gelding that he was all
but caught in the passageway by the rearing,
screaming beast. He could hear Sarah calling
him, beside herself with fear. He could see the
flame licking at the edges of the doorway and
eating at the lintel.</p>

<p>"Steady, boy. Steady."</p>

<p>He patted the nervous shoulder, talked quietly
to the frantic animal. Slowly the horse subsided,
seemed to listen, followed Stud in a dash through
the door not a moment too soon as the flaming
lintel came crashing down behind them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>When the fire reached the haymow there was
a flare and flash almost like an explosion as the
dust and loose hay ignited. All the colors from
blue-white to crimson played across the surface
of the hay. Then the fifty tons of timothy, alfalfa,
and clover settled down to a forty-eight
hour blaze. Flame and smoke sucked and twisted
up the hay chutes like dust in a tornado. These
blasts cut through the shingled roof like a dozen
blow-torches and spurted their yellow pennants
skyward. The flames licked and bellied in the
wind, belched from the open door of the loft
with the hollow intonation of a big gun.</p>

<p>"Help pull the hayfork down," cried Gus. He
said in after years that he had intended to fasten
barrels of water to the fork, run them down the
fork track, and dump them on the flame. Before
he could attempt the impractical scheme the ropes
had burned and the fork had fallen with a crash,
imbedding itself in the snow and mud.</p>

<p>Finally the fire department arrived. The big
dapple grays had run four miles dragging the
heavy fire engine through the slushy snow. They
galloped into the barnyard lathered and panting,
the red wheels and brass mountings of their engine
flashing in the fire-light, steam and smoke
belching from the funnel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Unwind the hose, boys," shouted Hank Vetter.
"Where's the water, Stud?"</p>

<p>"We'll use the tanks and then the cistern,"
Stud roared. "I got the gasoline engine pumping
from the well."</p>

<p>But all these sources were soon insufficient for
the two inch hose through which the fire engine
forced its stream. They led the hose to the creek,
chopped a hole through the ice, and began to
pump from the deep hole beside the mill. The
water sprayed upon the burning roof, was shot in
through the loft door; hissed into the inferno
leaving scarcely a trace.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Stud. "There goes the
roof!" It fell with a mighty crash throwing embers
high into the air, shooting flames seventy-five
feet above the barn: blue, yellow, and red against
the inky sky; lighting up the countryside from
Cottonwood Hill to Charley's Bluff. Another
fire was burning on the frozen lake, the flames
pointing downward toward the center of the
earth.</p>

<p>Then the timbers holding up the hay collapsed
and half-a-hundred tons of burning grass fell into
the stables. The great stallion screamed once and
then was still.</p>

<p>Sarah came over to comfort Stud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've got each other and most of the stock,"
she said.</p>

<p>"We'll make it somehow, Mother. We'll start
all over."</p>

<p>"I'll go to the house now and fix something for
the firemen."</p>

<p>"I guess you might as well."</p>

<p>Hank Vetter, chief of the volunteers, left his
engine and came over to where Stud was listening
to the condolences of his neighbors.</p>

<p>"How'd it start?" yelled Hank.</p>

<p>"Darned if I know," said Stud, scratching his
singed head. "I was tending a sick stallion
and...."</p>

<p>"Was you smoking?" asked Hank.</p>

<p>"Never smoked around the barns in my life."</p>

<p>"Didn't tip over the lantern?"</p>

<p>"Lantern was hanging from a peg. Never
touched the lantern."</p>

<p>"Well, it couldn't have started by itself," said
Hank. "Let's look around."</p>

<p>They had taken less than a dozen steps down
the lane when a figure started up from behind
a stump, jumped the fence, crashed down the
hill toward the lake, and began to skirt the
bay.</p>

<p>"It's Joe Valentine," shouted Early Ann.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is my job," Stud cried, dashing after the
fleeing figure.</p>

<p>Hearing shouts, Joe Valentine decided to risk
the shortest way to Lake House Point. He leaped
onto the melting ice and ran and stumbled two
hundred yards out from the shore. They saw him
clearly in the light of the burning barn as he
crashed through into the black water and went
down; and although they watched the dark hole
in the ice for twenty minutes he did not come up
again.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3 class="p2">1</h3>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>During the spring of 1914 Edith Cavell was
going quietly about her civilian duties of mercy
in Brussels. A Bolshevik agitator by the name
of Lenin was hiding in Galicia sending anonymous
articles to Russian newspapers. Franklin
Delano Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the
U.S. Navy, attended the ceremonies which began
construction of battleship number 39, "the
greatest fighting machine in the universe." Villa
had the federals on the run south of the Rio
Grande. The veteran Joffre deep in Plan 17 eyed
the aging but wily von Moltke across the Rhine.
Aunt Martha in her Household Hints suggested
putting ordinary glass marbles in the tea-kettle
to keep the lime from gathering.</i></p>


<p class="pn p1">But on the Brailsford farm they were building
a new barn.</p>

<p>For twenty-four hours the Brailsfords had been
stunned by the loss. They had gone about their
duties in a daze. No one had seen Sarah crying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
but her eyes were rimmed with red, and Stanley
silently mourned the loss of his big Percheron
and the Jersey heifers.</p>

<p>Then, while the last charred timbers were still
smouldering they turned to the more consoling
thought of reconstruction. They would have a
magnificent new barn with arching roof and silver
ventilators. They would have a barn which
would house fifty head of cattle besides the horses,
with a hayloft twice the size of the old one.</p>

<p>Peter came home every week-end to help with
the work. He insisted that the barn be piped with
drinking water for the cattle, that the steel stanchions
and cement floor be of the latest design,
and that whole banks of windows replace what
had previously been almost windowless stone
walls.</p>

<p>They worked with frantic haste for soon it
would be spring, soon there would be a quarter
section to plow and plant. Already the ice was
breaking, the gulls were screaming overhead;
great flights of wild ducks and geese were wedging
their way northward.</p>

<p>Stripped to his shirt sleeves even in the early
March winds Stud Brailsford worked early and
late. He helped the carpenters to lift the big
four-by-eights and two-by-twelves into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
places, drove thirty-penny spikes as though they
were finishing nails. He helped to build the
forms and pour the cement; wheeled big barrows
of sand, gravel and concrete; brought stone-boat
loads of hard heads to fill the sloping ramp.</p>

<p>Saws ripped through clean-smelling wood;
hammers rang from dawn until dark; wagonloads
of lumber, shingles, barn-equipment and
paint came out daily from Brailsford Junction;
and by the twentieth of March the cows and
horses were in their new, luxurious home.</p>

<p>It took all the insurance money on the old barn
and nearly every cent Stud Brailsford had in the
bank. The big man was weary, hard-hit financially,
and definitely older. But he looked up
proudly at his great new barn and smiled.</p>

<p>Before Stud put a fork of hay in the mow they
had a barn dance. Corn meal was strewn over the
wide pine boards and a four-piece orchestra from
Brailsford Junction was hired for the occasion.
The old folks danced the square dances to the
squeaking of the fiddle, and Stud who had not
called the figures in fifteen years called them that
night as was his privilege since he owned the
barn. Neither he nor Sarah had gone to a dance
in ten years, nevertheless he led her proudly in
the grand march and the Virginia Reel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Later the young folks, to the scandalization
of their elders, danced the tango and the turkey
trot, and they all ended the evening with "Home,
Sweet Home" and plenty of apple cider.</p>

<p>"I guess we can still kick up our heels," said
Stanley, escorting his wife from the barn to the
kitchen door.</p>

<p>"Gee, you sure can rag," Early Ann told the
glowing Peter.</p>

<p>"Maybe I can't dance so good," Gus confessed
to the new school teacher, "but I know where
there's another jug of apple jack."</p>

<p>Almost before the paint was dry on the barn
it was lambing time, and night and day for more
than a week the Brailsfords helped the bleating
ewes and their small dependents, warmed chilled
lambs in the "hospital" at the corner of the shed
and gave the weakened mothers encouraging shots
of brandy. Four times there were twins and once
triplets. To Stud's dismay one little black lamb
made its appearance&mdash;a disgrace to his exceptionally
pure flock of Shropshires. As chance
would have it the little black fellow was
orphaned and no ewe could be made to adopt
it, so Early Ann raised him a pet on a baby
bottle.</p>

<p>The great old ram was kept securely locked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
in his pen through all these proceedings. He
looked on indifferently through the bars, his
thick white wool glowing and healthy; his massive,
wide head, broad shoulders and low-slung
chassis the very essence of masculinity.</p>

<p>"He's got a leg on each corner," said Stanley
admiringly, stopping to pet the father of sixty-four
new sons and daughters.</p>

<p>The pony mare and one of the Percherons
dropped foals within the next two weeks, and
fawn-eyed Jersey calves arrived almost daily.
At the Oleson farm another little Swede entered
the world. Sarah and Temperance Crandall were
on hand to help the midwife, but Early Ann was
strictly forbidden to go near the place until the
baby was born, washed, and placed in his hand-carved
cradle. The arrival of three small billy
goats, and twelve litters of Poland China pigs
increased the blessed events on the west shore
of Lake Koshkonong to a staggering figure.</p>

<p>Stud Brailsford, deep in the spring plowing,
had no time to think of any woman. He bought
a brooder and an incubator for Sarah, and evenings
he went into the cellar to tinker with the
new contraptions. In due time flotillas of fluffy
ducklings, eight hundred scrambling, peeping
chicks, and a dozen long-necked, awkward, yellow-green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
goslings were in evidence on every
hand.</p>

<p>One night the orchard was taken in a single
onslaught by the rush of spring. The fragrant
white billow swept over apple, cherry, plum, and
Sarah's flowering crab. Underneath the laden
trees the dandelions bloomed, and the bees came
to plunder.</p>

<p>Once again spring was upon the land.</p>

<h3 class="p2">2</h3>

<p class="pn p1">It might have occurred to Stanley&mdash;but never
did&mdash;that throughout the spring the boy had
seemed curiously devoted to the farm, unwilling
to miss a single week-end in the country. It should
have seemed strange to Brailsford that when the
"Trailer" went bankrupt in May, Peter took the
loss of his job so philosophically. But all that
Stud thought, when he thought about the matter
at all, was now his boy was back at last, that he
had sown his wild oats and was ready to settle
down, and that during the coming season he
would make him thrashing boss again.</p>

<h3 class="p2">3</h3>

<p class="pn p1">On the morning of June 28, 1914&mdash;the day
that Gavro Princip shot the Archduke Ferdinand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
at Serajevo&mdash;Stud Brailsford awoke just before
dawn. Ducks were quacking, geese hissing in the
barnyard. Roosters were heralding the dawn, answered
across the lake by other roosters. A cow
bawled at her calf, the wind rustled in the corn.
Ten miles away a train whistled, and rumbled
across the river bridge. To Stud's simple mind
the world had never seemed more peaceful. The
smell of coffee, toast and sausage drifted up from
the kitchen. The first streaks of color were showing
in the east, reflected on the surface of the lake.</p>

<p>Stud did not know that Europe was an armed
camp, that civilization was about to be blown to
bits, that Wisconsin farm boys, whistling as they
went to the barns that morning, would soon be
lying in the mud of Flanders. Stud had never
heard of the Archduke Ferdinand nor of Serajevo.
You could not have convinced him that a
shot fired by a Serb in remote Bosnia could affect
his prosperous dairy farm on Crabapple Point in
the Fertile Rock River valley of Southern Wisconsin.</p>

<p>It was Sunday. Peter and Gus were already up
and doing the chores. Stud could lie abed for another
half hour if he wished. He could go swimming
in the lake, or merely lie in the hammock
under the trees, listening to the birds and taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
life easy. Such indolence was all but unbelievable
to the big farmer who for the past three and one-half
months had been working sixteen hours a
day, laboring evenings and holidays, even breaking
God's commandment by plowing on Sunday.
But at last the crops were planted; the corn was
knee-high, and the twenty acres of tobacco were
a rich, healthy green.</p>

<p>Stud yawned, stretched like a big cat, rolled
out of bed and donned clean blue shirt and overalls.
Carrying his shoes and socks in his hand he
padded down the stairs, enjoying the feeling of
the cool, smooth wood under his bare feet. Sarah
and Early Ann were busy over the kitchen stove,
the spot where they spent many a Sabbath.</p>

<p>"Sleepy-head," taunted Early Ann. "Chores
are most done."</p>

<p>For the first time since the burning of the barn
Stud really noticed the girl. My, she was pretty!
After breakfast he saw her take sunbonnet and
milkpail and start up the path toward the strawberry
patch beyond the hill. Ten minutes after
she was out of sight, he followed.</p>

<p>Sarah Brailsford guessed where he was going,
and why, but she did not raise a finger to stop
him. Gus Gunderson knew by second nature
what was up. Stud, chewing a stem of Timothy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
climbed the hill, skirted the orchard, and there
he found them.</p>

<p>For a moment Stanley Brailsford was dumbfounded.
Then a slow smile spread over his face.
Briefly he stayed to watch Early Ann and Peter
sitting on the grassy bank with their arms around
each other, looking off across the lake.</p>

<p>Slowly old Brailsford retraced his steps, saying
to no one in particular, "Grandchildren. Ho,
ho! I never thought of grandchildren. Wonder
what it'll be like to be a grandfather?"</p>

<p>He was still chuckling when he sat down beside
Sarah on the front porch.</p>

<p>"You know, when Peter and Early Ann get
married, I'm going to build them a house on Cottonwood
Hill."</p>

<p>"I think that would be real nice," said Sarah.
"It's the prettiest view in southern Wisconsin."</p>

<p>"I hope they have a dozen children, Mother.
I'd like about seven boys and five girls. They'll
be blue-ribbon babies if that pair breeds 'em."</p>
